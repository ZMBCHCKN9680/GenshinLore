 Unborn life, unfulfilled wishes,  
Tragic dreams at the edge of the universal darkness that could never come true,  
Indwell my body, and descend unto this world. -> These dreams that dont go into irminsul go into abyss? 

Childe transformed from a timid boy to a bloodthirsty, conflict-seeking egoist that seeks to conquer the world and Gold became the creator / leader of the Abyss monsters that attacked Teyvat during the Cataclysm 500 years ago. The closer proximity to the moon in the Abyss compared to Teyvat could explain the extreme changes in personality experienced by these two individuals. The closer one is to the source, the stronger the effects.

One can only wonder: what dreams might be woven from the sharp claws and fangs of these hidden beasts?

Based on the brief descriptions about her, it appears that Rhinedottir was an ambitious woman who sought erudition — and obtained the "apex achievement" of creating life itself.[[4]](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rhinedottir?so=search#cite_note-4)

How Inazuma Arc signofies the suppression of dream and them fighting back

This quality may have attracted the [Abyss](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Abyss "Abyss") to her, and nurtured the "uncanny powers" that she used to wreak havoc on Teyvat.[[Note 1]](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rhinedottir?so=search#cite_note-5)

The Wolflord has no name, for it was but one of "[Gold](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Gold "Gold")"'s unintentional creations, and that is precisely why it is obsessed with invading worlds that do not belong to it and making a name for itself.

The English version of Breeze Amidst the Forest characterizes Gold as "corrupted by their own greed and ambition." However, the equivalent sentence in the original Chinese text simply says that Gold was a "sinner."

In Dainsleif's [character introduction](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dainsleif#Official_Introduction "Dainsleif"), a "<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">self-proclaimed prophet</mark>" says "Chalk pursues gold, in this time inopportune, the eclipse is swallowed by the crimson moon," which may be an allusion to Albedo, Rhinedottir, Khaenri'ah, and the cataclysm respectively.

Tartaglia's [Character Stories](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tartaglia/Lore#Character_Stories "Tartaglia/Lore") say that the Abyss was attracted to the "burning ambition" in his heart, and he trained under the Abyssal swordswoman Skirk for three months. By the time he reemerged in Teyvat, only three days after his disappearance, he gained the ability to "stir up endless havoc" from his "trouble-mongering nature". It is likely that Rhinedottir was in a similar situation.

Durin good boi 

Durin corrupting the tree made the tree bitter, but durin never had any grudge while dying anyway. so ambitions become ill will with time or abyssal corruption

primogems represent the condensed hopes and dreams of universes that once were.

What exactly is Xiao wrestling with?
The tactful answer would be old grudges, unfulfilled dreams, the lamentations of the vanquished...

Durin's skull faces towards the west-northwest, where [Celestia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Celestia "Celestia") floats above. [Roald](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Roald "Roald") the Adventurer wondered if Durin still "yearns for the celestial heights".

A creepy straight sword that almost <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">seems to yearn for life</mark>. It drips with a shriveling venom that could even corrupt a mighty dragon.

"Now then, this great blessing that pulses through my veins,"  
"And lovely sight of the dark universe that gave me birth..."  
"They are now yours to inherit."

A strange gem left behind by a foe from the Abyss. If you look into it hard, it is almost as if you are looking into a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">long-borne dream shrouded by a deep fog.</mark>

Dream solvent,dottore blue fluid, dottore curing eleazar notes https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Eleazar

why are vision holders not affected from withering or karmin debt is because the vision absorbs them

and prolonged exposure can drastically alter a person's personality by exacerbating their desires. ZHiqiong example too
There, he witnessed the endless possibilities of another ancient world. There, he would meet a mysterious swordswoman...

Or perhaps one should say that this dark realm had sensed the burning ambition in this boy's heart.

This darkness was something that the Harbinger Childe could never again delve into.
