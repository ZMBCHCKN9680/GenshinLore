In the perpetual meantime of a sheltered eternity, most are content to live, and not to dream.

As your stars move across the sky, they record all your life events in their path. And among all the people in the world, a considerable number will see their stars deviate from their path.

We must all live within the confines of reality, but... call me presumptuous, but I still believe in miracles.

But within Teyvat, the stars in the sky will always have a place for us. Even if astrology is resolutely rational, fate remains arbitrary, cruel, but romantic.

"Now, I will seize my own destiny."

There's no time limit for you. I will register you as 'custodian' rather than 'borrower'.








Unborn life, unfulfilled wishes,  
Tragic dreams at the edge of the universal darkness that could never come true,  
Indwell my body, and descend unto this world. -> These dreams that dont go into irminsul go into abyss? 
Childe transformed from a timid boy to a bloodthirsty, conflict-seeking egoist that seeks to conquer the world and Gold became the creator / leader of the Abyss monsters that attacked Teyvat during the Cataclysm 500 years ago. The closer proximity to the moon in the Abyss compared to Teyvat could explain the extreme changes in personality experienced by these two individuals. The closer one is to the source, the stronger the effects.
