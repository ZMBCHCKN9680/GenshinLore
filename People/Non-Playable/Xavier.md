**Xavier** is an [NPC](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/NPC "NPC") found near the [Mikage Furnace](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mikage_Furnace "Mikage Furnace") in [Inazuma](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Inazuma "Inazuma"). He is originally from the town of [[Petrichor]], [[Fontaine]]. After completing both [Tatara Tales](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tatara_Tales "Tatara Tales") and ["The Seventh Samurai"](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/%22The_Seventh_Samurai%22 ""The Seventh Samurai""), he relocates to the [Kujou Encampment](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kujou_Encampment "Kujou Encampment") where he can be found together with [Toranosuke](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Toranosuke "Toranosuke") south-east of the teleport waypoint.

Xavier plays a major role in the [Tatara Tales](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tatara_Tales "Tatara Tales") World Quest series. While he can be encountered before starting the [first quest](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tatara_Tales_(Quest) "Tatara Tales (Quest)"), he cannot be interacted with.

## Profile

Xavier, along with a group of Fontaine experts, helped develop the [Mikage Furnace](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mikage_Furnace "Mikage Furnace") for the Shogun's Army to produce Jade Steel using the power of [Tatarigami](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tatarigami "Tatarigami"). Xavier opted to stay behind in order to film the furnace at action in the hopes of promoting Fontaine's technology, but the furnace went critical and he was forced to develop a containment dome to stop the energy from leaking out. He could not do anything as the [Tenryou Commission](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tenryou_Commission "Tenryou Commission") were too busy to handle his request. He also taught the people at [Higi Village](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Higi_Village "Higi Village") how to make [Imported Poultry](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Imported_Poultry "Imported Poultry").

Eventually, the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler") came along and discovered that the [Fatui](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Fatui "Fatui") had taken an interest in the Tatarigami. Xavier was alarmed at what they would do it, and fast-tracked a device to purify the energy. Thanks to the Traveler, he was able to purify the furnace, preventing the Fatui from getting their hands on the Tatarigami energy unless they wanted to cause a war with the Tenryou Commission.

After the incident, Xavier resumed his intentions of creating movies in Inazuma, starting with "Tatara Tales" to re-enact the Traveler's fight against the Fatui. He also began production of another film, "The Seventh Samurai," which was accepted by the [Tenryou Commission](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tenryou_Commission "Tenryou Commission") as they believed it would help increase the Shogunate's prestige.

### Personality

He prefers to follow rules and established procedures, but he is willing to disregard them when they are insufficient for dealing with grave situations.

Somewhat flamboyant and touchy feely, even more so when drunk. Tends to refer to the people he meets as "dear". _(To be completed)_
