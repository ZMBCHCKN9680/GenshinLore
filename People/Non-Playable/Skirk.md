**Skirk** is the mysterious swordswoman whom [Tartaglia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tartaglia "Tartaglia") describes as his master and is likely the one who taught him the art of battle during his time in [[Abyss]].

## Profile

So far, Skirk has only been mentioned in regards to Tartaglia's backstory. According to Tartaglia, Skirk is an exceptionally skilled and seasoned warrior; while he is known as one of the most dangerous among the [Eleven Fatui Harbingers](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Eleven_Fatui_Harbingers "Eleven Fatui Harbingers") and was explicitly recruited for his combat prowess, he states that she could easily beat him with one hand. He is optimistic that in their next encounter at his current power, he can force her to use both of them.

She is said to live in another ancient world, the dark realm, or the darkest corners of the universe. In her realm, time flows differently from the known world; three months in her realm amount to three days in [Teyvat](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Teyvat "Teyvat"). Although her affiliation with the [[Abyss Order]] is not attested, she at least knows how to survive in the Abyss and taught the way to Childe.

## Trivia

-   She is speculated to have some connection to [[Khaenri'ah]] or the [Abyss Order](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Abyss_Order "Abyss Order"), considering she is a warrior who dwells in the Abyss.
    -   Tartaglia's melee combat style, which he learned from Skirk, bears similarity to the [[Abyss Herald]]'s Hydro abilities (see [his Trivia section](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tartaglia/Lore#Trivia "Tartaglia/Lore") for details).
-   It is unclear whether the quotes within [Childe](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Enter_the_Golden_House#Boss_Description "Enter the Golden House")'s Archive description are narrated by Skirk or the [Tsaritsa](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tsaritsa "Tsaritsa").
-   It is also speculated that she could belong to the [Hexenzirkel](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hexenzirkel "Hexenzirkel") since she was dwelling so deep inside the abyss. This assumption is supported by the fact that her powers seem to be of a nature we have not encountered yet, similar to [Alice](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Alice "Alice").

## Notes

Strictly speaking, the name "Skirk" appears only in Tartaglia's voiceline. However, as Tartaglia himself and his backstory consistently talk about his background as if he has only one main martial-arts master, it can be assumed that the master Skirk and the master in his backstory are the same person.
