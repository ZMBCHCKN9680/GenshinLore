## Profile

Andersdotter was a human mage and a member of the Hexenzirkel, whose way with words were able to teach [Alice](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Alice "Alice") the meaning of grief. In their letter to [I. Ivanovna N.](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/I._Ivanovna_N. "I. Ivanovna N."), Andersdotter was described as "a legend that never ends" for her stories.

In _The Mages' Tea Party_ cutscene, Andersdotter is represented first by the cover of _The Boar Princess_, and later by the titular Boar Princess and the Wolf Pup.

## Story

When [[I. Ivanovna N.]] decided that she would leave the group after marrying, Alice, Andersdotter, Alice, [[Nicole]], and [Rhinedottir](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rhinedottir "Rhinedottir") wrote her a letter disguised as a prophecy, asking her to come visit them one last time before her wedding.

Later on, I. Ivanovna contacted them to tell them about her decision to end her husband's life in his old age. After Rhinedottir's remark, Andersdotter commented to the group that because her lifespan was much shorter than some of theirs, she wished to leave her storybook — _The Boar Princess_ — to them. Her remark that this story might even be passed down to the next generation piqued [Barbeloth](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Barbeloth "Barbeloth")'s interest.

## Trivia
