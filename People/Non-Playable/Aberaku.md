## Other names:

- **Abrax** - Abrax is likely derived from [Abraxas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraxas "wikipedia:Abraxas"), a term and figure among the [Basilideans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilideans "wikipedia:Basilideans"), a [Gnostic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism "wikipedia:Gnosticism") sect. Abraxas' actual role and the meaning of his name are unclear, as most sources about Abraxas' role are not derived from Basilides' teachings; however, it is generally believed that Abraxas is the "great archon" and the ruler of the 365 heavens.

## Description : 

**Aberaku no Mikoto**, also known as **Abrax**, was a historical figure who lived in [Enkanomiya](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Enkanomiya "Enkanomiya"). He was the creator of the [Dainichi Mikoshi](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dainichi_Mikoshi "Dainichi Mikoshi"), the artificial sun that saved the nation from the threat of the [Bathysmal Vishaps](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Bathysmal_Vishaps "Bathysmal Vishaps"). After his death, his emotions and memories were preserved as a [Sinshade](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sinshade "Sinshade").

Aberaku was recognized as a sage who was enlightened by the [Tokoyo Ookami](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tokoyo_Ookami "Tokoyo Ookami") during the "Year of Blindness" in Enkanomiya's history and discovered a method to bring light to the lightless nation, which led him to create the tower Helios, later known as the Dainichi Mikoshi. The second year after Helios was completed, Aberaku was imprisoned by the [[Sunchildren|Sunchild]], the figure who had been appointed ruler over Enkanomiya. By the tenth year after Helios' completion, Aberaku was "long gone."

After his death, his memories were preserved in the ley lines, leading him to manifest as a [Shade of Tokoyo](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Shade_of_Tokoyo "Shade of Tokoyo").

### Personality

Aberaku had something of an ego due to his pride over his creation of the Dainichi Mikoshi, to the point where he would theatrically introduce himself as "Aberaku, Helios-Forger" in conversation. Regardless, he was a good man, as he opposed the nobles who controlled the [Sunchildren](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sunchildren "Sunchildren"), did not blame the Sunchildren for their tyranny even though many of the people of Enkanomiya did, and regretted his inability to save them and Enkanomiya.

### Appearance

Like most [shades](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Shades_of_Tokoyo "Shades of Tokoyo"), he is a translucent humanoid figure without defining physical features.
