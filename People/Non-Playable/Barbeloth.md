She is also the friend and rival of [Alice](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Alice "Alice"), a famous adventurer and powerful mage. She is only talented in astrology, whilst Alice was well versed in a variety of magical fields.

Like her rival, she is also a member of the [[Hexenzirkel]], where she uses the initial "B."
