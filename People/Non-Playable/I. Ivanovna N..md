## Profile

Little is known about I. Ivanovna's abilities or actions while she was alive. However, it is likely that like the other members of the Hexenzirkel, she was a rather powerful mage. She had a lineage of successors and followers, although none of them were acknowledged by Hexenzirkel Elder [Alice](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Alice "Alice") until Scarlett.

In _The Mages' Tea Party_ cutscene, I. Ivanovna is represented at the tea party with a pink teacup, with rose and thorn motifs in the background.

## Story

At some point in her life, I. Ivanovna fell in love with a man and decided to leave the Hexenzirkel after marrying. The day before she was going to be married, Alice, [[Andersdotter]], [[Nicole]], and [[Rhinedottir]] sent her a letter containing a "prophecy," which was actually a request for her to see them again. It can be assumed that she communicated with them using a Lantern of Utmost Joy; after her husband's passing, she told them that she had ended his life to ease him of his suffering.

Although I. Ivanovna passed away centuries ago, she passed her title onto her students and followers. Her most recent successor, Scarlett, had the prophecy which the Hexenzirkel members had written and sought to uncover information about it, leading to the events of [Windblume Festival](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Windblume_Festival "Windblume Festival").

## Trivia
