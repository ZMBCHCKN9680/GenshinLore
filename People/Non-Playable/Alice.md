**Alice** is [Klee](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Klee "Klee")'s mother, as well as a famous adventurer who authored the [Teyvat Travel Guide](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Teyvat_Travel_Guide "Teyvat Travel Guide"). She is a polymath whose skills include [alchemy](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy"), astrology, engineering, magic, and medicine. Additionally, she is an elder within the [Hexenzirkel](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hexenzirkel "Hexenzirkel"), an organization which both [Mona](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mona "Mona") and [Mona's Master](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mona%27s_Master "Mona's Master") also belong to.

While Alice has not yet been met in-person, she was directly involved in setting up the [Version 1.6](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Version_1.6 "Version 1.6") event _[Midsummer Island Adventure](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Midsummer_Island_Adventure "Midsummer Island Adventure")_ and left a phonograph record with a message from her for the event's attendees to find. She was also involved in sending the party to the [Golden Apple Archipelago](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Apple_Archipelago "Golden Apple Archipelago") again in [Version 2.8](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Version_2.8 "Version 2.8")'s event, _[Summertime Odyssey](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Summertime_Odyssey "Summertime Odyssey")_, although she does not seem to have a hand in the events that occur afterwards.

## Profile

> As well-versed in astrology as she was, my master knew only astrology. Alice, on the other hand, was skilled in a great many other mystical fields.
> 
> —[Mona](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mona "Mona"), [A Bewildering Fate](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/A_Bewildering_Fate "A Bewildering Fate")

Alice is an adventurer who belongs to a long-lived race and is at least 500 years old herself. She has allegedly seen the entire world and possibly even beyond, based on the description of [Wings of Feasting](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wings_of_Feasting "Wings of Feasting"), her reference to the [Rubicon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Rubicon "wikipedia:Crossing the Rubicon"), and her narration of [Aloy](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Aloy "Aloy")'s [Collected Miscellany](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Collected_Miscellany "Collected Miscellany") in [Dainsleif](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dainsleif "Dainsleif")'s place. While it is unclear what Alice does on her adventures besides satisfying her personal curiosity, she comments that _"Teyvat's borders have grown fragile these past two years — looks like Mommy's going to have to get busy"_ as to why she had to quickly leave her family again after delivering the Wings of Feasting.

Alice's immense magical prowess is such that [Albedo](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Albedo "Albedo") calls her a "near-omnipotent sorceress," while [Diluc](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Diluc "Diluc") states that she is the only other person besides [Venti](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Venti "Venti"), the mortal form of the Anemo Archon [Barbatos](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Barbatos "Barbatos"), who could have arranged the events at the [Golden Apple Archipelago](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Apple_Archipelago "Golden Apple Archipelago") during _Midsummer Island Adventure_. Mona also speaks favorably of Alice's skillset and sought out Alice's successor — Klee — in hopes that their combined knowledge would be enough to read the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler")'s fate, failing to anticipate the possibility that Alice had not passed any of her magical skills on to Klee. She also states that the [Narukami Pillars](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Narukami_Pillar "Narukami Pillar") on [Yashiori Island](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Yashiori_Island "Yashiori Island"), which suppress the [Tatarigami](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tatarigami "Tatarigami") and were allegedly created by the [Raiden Shogun](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Raiden_Shogun "Raiden Shogun"), were created with techniques that are "quite familiar to [her]."

Alice touts a commendable number of skills and contributions to the world of Teyvat, which includes but is not limited to:

-   Astrology
-   Alchemy
-   Creating puzzles and Hydro Barriers throughout the [Golden Apple Archipelago](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Apple_Archipelago "Golden Apple Archipelago")
-   Explosives-crafting
    -   Creating [Dodoco](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dodoco "Dodoco"), an explosive doll which she taught Klee how to make
-   Inventing a [phonograph](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/%22Witch%27s_Chorus%22 ""Witch's Chorus"")
-   Inventing the [Temari](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Temari "Temari") game
-   Potion-concocting
-   Testing various scientific endeavors and engineering projects, although most of her known attempts ended in failure
-   Inventing a [long-distance instant communication device](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dodocommunication_Device "Dodocommunication Device")

### Personality

Alice is a free-spirited person who exercises little restraint and acts impulsively. She blew up parts of [Stormterror's Lair](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Stormterror%27s_Lair "Stormterror's Lair") because she felt that the ruins didn't seem ancient enough, and concocted a potion to cure [Echo](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Echo "Echo")'s stutter, only to leave him with the side effect of only being able to imitate others around him. Both [Jean](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Jean "Jean") and [Albedo](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Albedo "Albedo") remark that Klee takes after her mother in many ways, with Albedo commenting that his only relief is that Klee is not yet as destructive as Alice.

Despite her impulsiveness, Alice is also quite powerful and intelligent, taking inspiration from her adventures to draft various ideas and experiments. She also dotes on Klee a great deal and Klee, in turn, adores her. Alice devised [Dodoco](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dodoco "Dodoco") after observing [Amber](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Amber "Amber")'s [Baron Bunny](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Baron_Bunny "Baron Bunny") and designed an entire fictional story revolving around it for Klee to enjoy, going as far as to arrange the events at the [Golden Apple Archipelago](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Apple_Archipelago "Golden Apple Archipelago") and invite several people whom Klee is close with for a summer vacation. She also secretly checks in on Klee at Mondstadt while she performs her job.

Alongside doting on her real daughter, Alice shows her maternal side to those who treat Klee well. She insisted that Albedo call her "mother" (to which he refused) and decided that he was now part of their family. Following [Crepus](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Crepus "Crepus")' death several years ago, Alice sent [Diluc](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Diluc "Diluc") a condolence letter in which she also insisted on treating him like her own child due to the way he had cared for Klee in the past.

### Appearance

Alice has long elf-like ears like Klee does.

## Story

### History

Alice became acquainted with the [Khaenri'ahn](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Khaenri%27ah "Khaenri'ah") alchemist [Rhinedottir](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rhinedottir "Rhinedottir") at an unknown point in the past; the two have a close enough bond that Rhinedottir later sent [Albedo](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Albedo "Albedo"), her apprentice and creation, to seek Alice out for help with his final assignment. Alice, in turn, brought him to the [Knights of Favonius](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Knights_of_Favonius "Knights of Favonius") in [Mondstadt](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mondstadt "Mondstadt"), believing they had the resources to build a large research lab for him.

Alice became acquainted with [Yae Miko](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Yae_Miko "Yae Miko") at some point, calling the over 500-year-old kitsune a "little girl" and recounts in the Inazuma edition of the _Teyvat Travel Guide_ how easy it was to make Miko cry. Alice also mentions [Asase Hibiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Asase_Hibiki "Asase Hibiki") as "that killjoy shrine maiden" and [Neko](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Neko "Neko") as "that fat cat," further indicating that she traveled to [Inazuma](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Inazuma "Inazuma") after the [cataclysm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm") 500 years ago.

Fifty years ago, Alice made a pact with her friend and rival, [Mona's Master](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mona%27s_Master "Mona's Master"), resulting in Alice taking possession of her diary, which Alice in turn eventually left in Klee's care.

At some point in time, Alice met Klee's father, another renowned adventurer, during her travels. They had Klee, and decided to stay in Mondstadt for a while to raise her. Around this time, Albedo sought her out at Rhinedottir's behest, leading Alice to take the boy in and insist on treating each other as a "real family," further insisting that Albedo refer to her as "mother." Alice also imparted [Barbara](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Barbara "Barbara") with the "Idol Magazine," inspiring the young deaconess to become an "idol" for Alice's "Teyvat Idols!" group, although the group never came to fruition due to recruitment troubles.

Sometime after Crepus died four years before the game's start, Klee noticed Diluc's disappearance, which prompted Alice to look into the matter. After finding out about Crepus' passing, Alice sent Diluc a lengthy letter to express her condolences and give him words of encouragement.Three years before the game's start, Alice and Klee's father went to travel "somewhere dangerous and far away," and entrusted Klee to Albedo and the Knights of Favonius.

Alice began writing the Teyvat Travel Guide in the recent past, documenting notable areas and features in her travels, although its highly personal and subjective writing style make the work read more like her personal diary rather than an actual travel guide. The Mondstadt and [Liyue](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Liyue "Liyue") editions began circulating some time ago, as [Jifang](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Jifang "Jifang") of the [Wanwen Bookhouse](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wanwen_Bookhouse "Wanwen Bookhouse") claims the Liyue edition has been out-of-print for some time due to its unpopularity.

The Mondstadt edition was likely written shortly after Alice's arrival in Mondstadt, before raising Klee. During that time, she observed Amber's Baron Bunny and was inspired to build an explosive doll, which eventually became known as Dodoco. She also became known for performing aerobatic stunts after launching herself with an [Anemo Slime](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Anemo_Slime "Anemo Slime"), only to receive a Gliding Violation from Jean.

While writing the Liyue edition, Alice became acquainted with [Zhongli](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Zhongli "Zhongli"), whom she described as "the sternest person" she knows. She also cured [Echo](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Echo "Echo") of his stutter, but the potion's side-effects cause him to be compelled to perfectly imitate those around him, which he is still afflicted by to this day.

While the Inazuma edition was first published during the [Irodori Festival](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Irodori_Festival "Irodori Festival"), its contents set Alice's experiences as occurring shortly before the outbreak of war a year ago. She attempted to recruit [Kamisato Ayaka](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kamisato_Ayaka "Kamisato Ayaka") for "Teyvat Idols!" only to be rebuffed at least six times, and befriended [Yoimiya](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Yoimiya "Yoimiya").

### Present Day

Shortly before the events of [Version 1.6](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Version_1.6 "Version 1.6"), Alice found the [Golden Apple Archipelago](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Apple_Archipelago "Golden Apple Archipelago") and thought of Klee. As a gift to her and to the people who were taking care of her, she decided to dress-up the islands, leaving behind various gadgets and games to turn it into a "summer park" for everyone to enjoy. In order to get everyone to come, she concocted a plan of leaving behind threatening letters, encouraging them to go to the island to deal with a fictional enemy, called 'Dodo-King.' However, once the last puzzle was dealt with, the truth was revealed through one of Alice's inventions, which she calls the "Alice Phonograph." She explained herself and the island and that she was already exploring another area in Teyvat. 

Sometime later, Alice returned to Mondstadt to visit Klee. During the trip, she ran into [Venti](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Venti "Venti") and gave him a [Dodocommunication Device](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dodocommunication_Device "Dodocommunication Device") to give to a friend of his, which he would give to the Traveler.

## Trivia

-   Alice is aware of an otherworldly outlander who was in Teyvat centuries before [Aloy](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Aloy "Aloy")'s theoretical arrival in Teyvat. As Aloy is a collaboration character and has not been integrated into any of Genshin Impact's story, it is unclear when Aloy's theoretical arrival in Teyvat would occur. Klee is shown in Aloy's Collected Miscellany outside of Aloy's gameplay showcase, but Alice and Klee are of a race "blessed with longevity," making it possible that Klee ages slowly. The outlander Alice is referring to may therefore be:
    -   The [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler"). Although the Traveler came to Teyvat with their sibling, the sibling is revealed to seemingly not share at least some of the Traveler's otherworldly properties.
    -   The Traveler's sibling. Although the sibling came to Teyvat with the Traveler, it is suggested that the sibling has more knowledge about the meaning of their arrival in Teyvat. The sibling's first destination after arriving in Teyvat was [Khaenri'ah](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Khaenri%27ah "Khaenri'ah"), which may also have something to do with their lack of otherworldly properties, and they came to Teyvat specifically because "the heavens responded to the summoning." It is therefore possible that the sibling garnered more attention as an otherwordly outlander than the Traveler did.
    -   Another otherworldly outlander.
-   Alice is familiar with Earth culture, introducing idol culture to Barbara via a magazine and having previously made statements about the [Rubicon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubicon "wikipedia:Rubicon"), with the implied context of the real-life phrase "[crossing the Rubicon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crossing_the_Rubicon "wikipedia:crossing the Rubicon")."
    -   While the Wings of Feasting were developed as part of a collaboration between [miHoYo](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/MiHoYo "MiHoYo") and [KFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFC "wikipedia:KFC"), and its description is narrated by Alice, the explanation for the Wings' appearance claims they originally had a blue-and-white color scheme which Alice later modified to be red-and-white to fit her family's tastes, rather than innately having KFC's red and white brand colors.
-   Alice is a strong candidate for one of the [Descenders](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Descender "Descender") recognized by the Fatui. Along with her knowledge of the world outside Teyvat, she is the only other known character besides the Traveler who is seemingly unaffected by changes to [Irminsul](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Irminsul "Irminsul").

### Etymology

-   Alice and her daughter, Klee, are of a race blessed with longevity and have pointed, [elf-like ears](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf "wikipedia:Elf"). However, the name of their race and whether or not [Teyvat](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Teyvat "Teyvat") has a name for their race is currently unknown.
    -   During _[The Final Riddle: A Secret Uncovered](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Final_Riddle:_A_Secret_Uncovered "The Final Riddle: A Secret Uncovered")_, the Chinese equivalent for [Kaeya](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kaeya "Kaeya")'s comment about how Alice and Klee are "kindred spirits, both wild and free" is 母女俩都是自由自在的精灵 "The mother and daughter both are free and unfettered _jīnglíng_." 精灵 _jīnglíng_ primarily refers to supernatural entities in a broad sense, such as elves, spirits, and fairies.
        -   In the field of European legends and fantasy, 精灵 _jīnglíng_ mainly refers to elves, 灵 _líng_ to spirits,  and _xiǎoxiānzi_ (小仙子) to fairies.  That said, _jīnglíng_ has previously been used to describe [Barbatos](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Barbatos "Barbatos") before he became [Archon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Archon "Archon"), and [Paimon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Paimon "Paimon"). For Barbatos, it was translated as both "elf"  and "spirit."  For Paimon, it was translated as "elf."  In addition, it is used as a part of the Chinese name for the [Lochfolk](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Lochfolk "Lochfolk")/Oceanid (纯水精灵 __chúnshuǐ-jīnglíng__, "Pure Water Elemental"). Given that none of them bear much resemblance to Klee nor to the typical depiction of an elf, translating the term _jīnglíng_ becomes complicated.
    -   The Japanese version unambiguously uses the term エルフ _Erufu_, "(European) elves" in its equivalent sentence; meanwhile, the Korean version phrases the above expression as "정말 자유로운 영혼을 가진," which roughly means "having truly free souls."
-   Albedo calls Alice "Aunt," although not in the familial sense of the word. In Chinese, he addresses her as 阿姨 _āyí_, a term which literally means "aunt" but is also used as an honorific for older women who have no blood relation to the speaker.
-   In the Chinese and Japanese versions, the Narukami-style rendering (Japanese-inspired name) of Eris, a historical figure in [Enkanomiya](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Enkanomiya "Enkanomiya"), is recorded by the Chinese characters 有栖 _Arisu_.  Historically, they were used as a part of the family name Arisugawa-no-Miya, a branch of the Imperial Family of Japan; meanwhile, in popular culture, they are commonly used as a kanji transcription of the English name Alice. However, there has not any other connection made between Eris (Arisu/Alice) and the adventurer Alice.
    -   Eris is probably named after [the goddess of the same name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_(mythology) "wikipedia:Eris (mythology)") in the Greek mythology (meaning "Strife"), known for having tossed the [Golden Apple of Discord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_of_Discord "wikipedia:Apple of Discord") into the feast of gods, which eventually caused the Trojan War. During _Midsummer Island Adventure_, Alice dubs the Haar Islands the "Golden Apple Archipelago," which is what the archipelago is known by in-game.
