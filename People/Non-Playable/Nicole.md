## Profile

Alice describes Nicole as a prophetess and an extraordinary woman who is studying "[Teyvat](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Teyvat "Teyvat")'s direction and order." She is also said to offer help to those in need of guidance, which led her to be known by other members of the Hexenzirkel as the "guide who will never get lost." However, she has a habit of talking in people's heads without warning.

## Story

While the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler") ruminates on the consequences of a person's [removal from Irminsul](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Irminsul#Removal_of_Information "Irminsul") following the incident with the [Wanderer](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wanderer "Wanderer"), who had removed his previous incarnation as [Scaramouche](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Scaramouche "Scaramouche") from Irminsul and affected Teyvat's known history, a mysterious voice speaks to the Traveler and [Paimon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Paimon "Paimon"), telling them: _"Unfortunately, the fate of Teyvat cannot easily be changed. Perhaps a [god](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/God "God") may have a slim chance, but for anyone else... who can say. [...] History does not change easily, but human hearts can. Believe your own eyes. Only that which you see is true. What is unseen is but an illusion."_ Her voice disappears after that, leaving no clue as to her identity.

Alice gives a brief description of Nicole while describing the members of the Hexenzirkel, explaining that Nicole only speaks to guide people toward the truth when a change has occurred in the world.
