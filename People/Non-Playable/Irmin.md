#Irmin #Khaenriah #EclipseDynasty 

**Irmin** was a king of [[Khaenri'ah]], suggested to be the last king of the [[Eclipse Dynasty]] before the [cataclysm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm") occurred.

## Profile

Little is known about Irmin besides the fact that he only had one eye. After his "strength failed," the [Alberich Clan](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Alberich_Clan "Alberich Clan") took the mantle as regents of Khaenri'ah. However, they were unable to revive the fallen nation.

## Trivia

-   The [statuettes](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Statuettes "Statuettes") dropped by [[Abyss Herald]], [[Abyss Lector]], and [[The Black Serpents]] depict a one-eyed figure, possibly Irmin. The statuettes are described as possibly representing a holy iconand inspiring courage in those who know their significance. If they are indeed modeled after Irmin, they would indicate he was missing his left eye.
    -   Of the few Khaenri'ahns presently depicted in human form, most of them ([Pierro](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Pierro "Pierro"), [[Dainsleif]], and [Kaeya](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kaeya "Kaeya")) are shown to cover the right sides of their face at all times, generally (though not always) including their right eyes. This is potentially a cultural practice that mirrors Irmin's missing left eye.
        -   [Halfdan](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Halfdan "Halfdan"), a former Khaenri'ahn royal guard who worked under Dainsleif's command, leaves his face fully unobstructed. This may indicate that it is a practice exclusive to those of higher stature, as Pierro was a royal mage of Khaenri'ah, Dainsleif was captain of the royal guard, and Kaeya is a member of the Alberich Clan. Alternatively, it may indicate it was a practice picked up after the nation's fall, which Halfdan did not consciously live to see.

### Etymology

-   The name "[Irmin](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Irmin#German "wiktionary:Irmin")" has Germanic roots but is not clearly defined, and several different interpretations of the name exist. It is believed to mean "Great" and is often used in compound words.
    -   The Germanic tribe of [Irminones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irminones "wikipedia:Irminones") is believed to be descended from Erminus (or Armen, among other spellings), one of the sons of [Mannus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannus "wikipedia:Mannus"). This belief led to Guido von List's [Arminism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminism "wikipedia:Arminism") — named after _Armamen_, whom List postulated to be ancient Aryan priest-kings — and [Armanen runes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armanen_runes "wikipedia:Armanen runes"), which were derived from the Germanic [Futhark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futhark "wikipedia:Futhark") runes.
        -   [Similar runes](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Languages#Runes "Languages") can be seen in-game through the tutorial images about [Abyss Mages](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Abyss_Mages "Abyss Mages")' shields. However, in gameplay, they typically use Enochian runes instead.
    -   The Viking Age Norse equivalent for Irmin is _Jörmunr_, which is used in the [Poetic Edda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_Edda "wikipedia:Poetic Edda") as an epithet for the Norse god [Odin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin "wikipedia:Odin").
    -   The word "[Irminsul](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Irminsul "Irminsul")" is a compound of _Irmin_ (great) + _sûl_ (pillar). In Saxon beliefs, Irminsul were sacred, pillar-like objects; in-game, "Irminsul" is the English localization's name for the silver-white trees found in [domains](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Domains "Domains"), which are linked to the [ley lines](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ley_line "Ley line").
