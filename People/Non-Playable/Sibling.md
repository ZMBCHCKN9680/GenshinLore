![[Traveler's_Sibling_Lumine.webp|300]]
The **Traveler's Sibling** is the lost twin sibling of the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler") and the supposed leader of the [[Abyss Order]]. The primary goal for the Traveler  is to find and reunite with their sibling — traveling through [Teyvat](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Teyvat "Teyvat"), obtaining information about them from meeting with [The Seven](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Seven "The Seven").

## Appearance

The physical appearance of the sibling is nearly identical to the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler"). Both have slim figures, with blond hair, golden-yellow eyes, and very pale skin. Lumine's hair is a bob cut with shoulder-length, straight twin-tails; while Aether's is medium cut with a long braid.

Lumine wears a pale white sleeveless dress with blue lines and tail capes, with gloves covering her thumbs. Also, she wears white stockings and boots; Aether wears a dark breastplate vest and black boots, with dark brown pants, a white scarf and a two-tailed cape with golden embroidery and decals.

It is revealed that certain parts of the Traveler's clothing light up based on the current element they are attuned to. In the opening cutscene, both siblings are seen with glowing white clothing and yellow wings. However, though they retain their glowing white clothes, the sibling has yet to show use of any of the Seven [Elements](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Elements "Elements") in or out of combat.

In the [Archon Quest](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Archon_Quest "Archon Quest"), [We Will Be Reunited](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/We_Will_Be_Reunited "We Will Be Reunited"), they are shown wielding the same [white-gold sword](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler%27s_Original_Sword "Traveler's Original Sword") as in the opening cutscene, but now it glows with dark energy.

## Personality

The sibling has a vendetta against the divine after finishing their journey across Teyvat for reasons unknown. They are solely devoted to accomplishing the goals of the Abyss Order regardless of what has to be done to do so. Despite their questionable actions, the sibling still cares for the Traveler, as they express a desire to return home with them after finishing their goals and convinces them to continue their journey across Teyvat to witness the truth themselves rather than forcing their views on them.

> We will be reunited, dear brother. But not here, not now. We will meet at this journey's end... Once the dust has settled. Then you will understand.

## Story

The twins initially fall to Teyvat while traveling between various worlds after their home world was destroyed. They crash-land and fall unconscious from their "meteorite" impact.

The [Traveler's](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler") Sibling is the first to awaken, and leaves the yet unconscious Traveler to heed to [[Khaenri'ah]]. The sibling then at some point witnesses the [Cataclysm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm") and the Gods destroying Khaenri'ah. They rush back to their impact-point and wake up The Traveler, showing them the destruction that's being wrought.

During the beginning cutscene in _[Genshin Impact](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact "Genshin Impact")_, both siblings are fighting against the [Unknown God](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Unknown_God "Unknown God"). Depending on which gender the player chooses, they will have a name attached to them and will become the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler"). The other sibling (**Lumine** or **Aether**) will then be attacked by the Unknown God and sent away in the form of a cube. The Traveler will then continue to fight before being subdued and having their powers sealed away, sent to wander the land until they come across [Paimon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Paimon "Paimon").

At some point after the Cataclysm, the Traveler's sibling wakes up, and travels the world of Teyvat with [[Dainsleif]]. Near the end of their journey, the Traveler's sibling realizes the "truth of this world" and parts ways with Dainsleif for reasons unknown.

During the Archon Quest, Prologue Chapter - Act III, intelligence passed on from [Kaeya](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kaeya "Kaeya") and background history from [Venti](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Venti "Venti") reveals that the [Abyss Order](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Abyss_Order "Abyss Order") has recently gained a new leader named the Prince or Princess.) At this point, while the Traveler does not know who this leader is, the player can conclude that the Prince or Princess is the Traveler's sibling.

In the story teaser trailer _We Will Be Reunited_, the Traveler's sibling is depicted as Lumine. In it, she is shown traveling through Mondstadt carried by a [Ruin Guard](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ruin_Guard "Ruin Guard") and is revealed to be behind the plot of the [[Abyss Mage|Abyss Mages]] to weaponize the dragon [Dvalin](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dvalin "Dvalin"). An Abyss Mage refers to her as "Your Highness" and proceeds to tell her about their foiled plan — she is shocked to learn from the Mage that her brother had a major role in foiling that plot. Later, she runs to a cliffside, where she witnesses her brother fight [hilichurls](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hilichurls "Hilichurls") in the grounds of [Stormterror's Lair](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Stormterror%27s_Lair "Stormterror's Lair") unbeknownst to her brother. This same area is revisited by the Traveler and [Dainsleif](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dainsleif "Dainsleif") during the quest [Bough Keeper: Dainsleif](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Bough_Keeper:_Dainsleif "Bough Keeper: Dainsleif") wherein the Traveler senses the previous presence of their sibling through the dandelion they stepped on previously. There, Dainsleif finds a Ruin Guard's footprint nearby while also speaking vaguely about a "traveling companion" he had been with before. It is later revealed that the sibling was Dainsleif's travel partner, but due to currently unknown circumstances, they did not reach the end together.

In the Archon Quest, Chapter I - Act IV: We Will Be Reunited, the Traveler's sibling briefly meets with the Traveler in front of the [Defiled Statue](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Defiled_Statue "Defiled Statue") after an altercation between the Traveler and an [[Abyss Herald]]. There, the sibling asks the Traveler to not stop them or the Abyss. The Traveler's sibling also reveals the truth of Dainsleif's origins and that the monsters of the Abyss were formerly [Khaenri'ah](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Khaenri%27ah "Khaenri'ah")'s people before being transformed by a curse. The Traveler tries to persuade them to continue with their original plan, which the sibling agrees with, but after their war against the divine is over. The sibling then tells them to continue traveling Teyvat in the hopes of seeing the true nature of the world presided by the Seven and Celestia before leaving with the Herald through a portal.

At some point, the sibling visited [The Chasm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chasm "The Chasm") and saw dead hilichurls, who had gone inside to die in peace due to a water pool receding the curse's effects. Angered and upset by their needless suffering, they authorized the activation of a device that would supposedly amplify the water's effects to the point that the curse would be removed for good regardless of the success rate. If the device worked, the hilichurls would be reverted to their previous forms as humans of Khaenri'ah, but if it failed, it would inflict extreme, needless pain on the hilichurls. As expected, the device backfired before it was destroyed by [Halfdan](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Halfdan "Halfdan") and the plan stopped by Dainsleif and the Traveler.

At some point in the past, the [Aranara](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Aranara "Aranara") race of [Sumeru](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sumeru "Sumeru") were visited by a human they called "Nara Varuna." The Aranara mention that this person was similar to the Traveler, frequently mentioned their sibling, and their pronouns change to be the opposite of the Traveler's, making it reasonable to assume Nara Varuna was the sibling. "Nara Varuna" was friendly to the Aranara and gained that name by helping with the [Varuna Contraption](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Varuna_Contraption "Varuna Contraption"). Before parting with the Aranara, "Varuna" told [Araja](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Araja "Araja") of another golden-haired human who would visit them in the future and give them even better memories.

In the Archon Quest, Chapter III - Act V: Akasha Pulses, The Kalpa Flame Rises, new snippets of knowledge were shared between the Traveler and [Nahida](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Nahida "Nahida"). The latter disclosed the information about the Traveler's identity as a [Descender](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Descender "Descender") of the world of Teyvat, while the Sibling is not by contrast. This conclusion was said to be from a presence of information gathered in the [Irminsul](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Irminsul "Irminsul") records about the Sibling, which is told to be impossible by Nahida unless if they (the Sibling) are naturally apart of the world to begin with. It is currently unknown as to why this is. Nahida also tells us that according to Irminsul, the sibling traveled Teyvat after the Cataclysm.

In the Archon Quest, Interlude Chapter, Act III - Inversion of Genesis, it is shown that [The Jester](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Pierro "Pierro") has lived with the Traveler's sibling for a period of time through the word of [Scaramouche](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Scaramouche "Scaramouche"). It was not disclosed within this quest as to when this occurred. It was said that the Traveler's sibling's first destination in Teyvat was to Khaenri'ah due to how "the heavens responded to the summoning".
