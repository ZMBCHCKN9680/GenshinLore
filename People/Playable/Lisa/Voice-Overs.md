**Hello** : Hi darling, are you going to be Lisa's little helper? What? Me, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a grand mage</mark>? That was a long time ago, I'm just a humble librarian now. *chuckles* Don't worry darling, I'll take very good care of you. So...

**About the Vision :** Visions? Ah, they're a necessary device in controlling the elements â€” with you being the sole exception, of course. Hmm... As for why that is, perhaps... we can find the time to experiment a little?

**Interesting Things :** [Calla Lilies](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Calla_Lily "Calla Lily") are a medicinal flower with antidotal properties. With them in hand, there's no need to worry about the side effects of any potions... Hehe.

**About Mona :** Mona? She seems to be an excellent mage, but I'm not a part of their [Hexenzirkel](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hexenzirkel "Hexenzirkel"). The idea of [Irminsul](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Irminsul "Irminsul") exploration and formal tea parties just leaves me cold.

**About Cyno :** I've barely kept in touch with anyone from the Akademiya since leaving Sumeru, except for the occasional letters to my teachers out of basic courtesy. Fortunately, not every promising student turned out as lazy as I am... I heard that one of my juniors, Cyno, now leads quite the action-packed life.

**More About Lisa V :** A Vision may seem like a great tool, but one day, the power one accumulates always finds a way to turn back on you. Should such a day come for me, so long as you're around... Ah, never mind.

**More About Lisa II :** My past? So, you want to get to know me a little better, huh? *chuckles* That's a story for another day. But I'm touched that you asked.

**Least Favorite Food** : I suffer from extreme pumpkinphobia. The fall harvest is a difficult time of year for me, as you can imagine. I wonder if it would be worth the trouble to make all the pumpkins in the world disappear...
