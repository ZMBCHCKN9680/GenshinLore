> A crystal that contains a sliver of [Tatarigami](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tatarigami "Tatarigami") power. Adding this material during smelting will greatly increase the strength and toughness of metals.
> In Inazuma, "Tatarigami" refers to the corpse of a divine being and the strange phenomena it creates. They say that before the god that created Crystal Marrow became the Tatarigami, it had many names, one of which was "[Orobashi no Mikoto](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Orobashi_no_Mikoto "Orobashi no Mikoto")." Orobashi no Mikoto's body was as long as the winding seashore, and its voice was so resounding that only the [Dark Sea](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Sea "Dark Sea") could absorb it. Yet in the end, it too was cut down together with [Yashiori Island](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Yashiori_Island "Yashiori Island") itself.

## Trivia

-   Crystal Marrow is a product of the [Tatarigami](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tatarigami "Tatarigami") power radiating from Orobashi's remnants on Yashiori Island, and is one of the materials used for the production of [Jade Steel](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Jade_Steel "Jade Steel") in [Mikage Furnace](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mikage_Furnace "Mikage Furnace"), hence why a certain amount is present west of the Furnace.
    -   The Crystal Marrow can be seen to be energizing the stream of water next to it, turning it into [Electro Water](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Electro_Water "Electro Water").
-   Crystal Marrow was used for the creation of [Delusions](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Delusions "Delusions") in Inazuma, and could be found in the [Delusion Factory](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Delusion_Factory "Delusion Factory").
-   When the Traveler first arrived in Inazuma, the president of the International Trade Association, [Kurisu](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kurisu "Kurisu"), revealed that the [Kanjou Commission](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kanjou_Commission "Kanjou Commission") had passed a tax decree forcing the merchants to pay taxes using Crystal Marrow instead of Mora. After collecting the taxes, the Crystal Marrow would then be sold back to the merchants at a much higher price.
