The **Crimson Agate** is an Adventure Item which can be found in the [[Dragonspine]] area. Crimson Agates can be offered to the [[Frostbearing Tree]] in Dragonspine for rewards, similar to the [Statues of the Seven](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Statue_of_The_Seven "Statue of The Seven") and the [Reputation](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Reputation "Reputation") system. They can be found scattered in the overworld, in certain [chests](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Chests "Chests"), or as a repeatable reward from completing a [Crimson Wish](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Crimson_Wish "Crimson Wish"). Chests that contain a Crimson Agate have a dark red aura surrounding them.

When an overworld Crimson Agate is within close proximity of a player, an icon will appear on their mini map along with a sound effect, like with other elemental [oculi](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Oculi "Oculi"). However, chests containing a Crimson Agate do not appear on the mini map. Additionally, Crimson Agates lack a corresponding [resonance stone](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Oculus_Resonance_Stone "Oculus Resonance Stone") to direct a player to their general location.

When the [nail](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Skyfrost_Nail "Skyfrost Nail") that froze Dragonspine descended, the trunk and canopy of this tree shattered into many fragments that were then frozen. A long time later, [[Durin|a black dragon]] fell into [the valley](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wyrmrest_Valley "Wyrmrest Valley") and its blood seeped into the ley lines. And a long time after that, [someone](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler") has broken the icy shackles, and the ancient tree that has absorbed that "crimson" has now sprouted anew...
