## Deciphered Text

Non custos si fingar ille Caenrium  
non fulmineus ego lyrae Barbatos  
non si pegaseo ferar volatu  
non Morphes niveae citaeque bigae  
adde huc plumipedas volatilesque  
ventorumque simul require cursum  
quos iunctos amica mea mihi dicares  
defessus tamen omnibus medullis  
et multis languoribus peresus  
essem te mihi amica quaeritando  
caelum dilabitur  
falsitas collabitur

### Temporary Translation

Not as if I were to be outfitted as that guardian of [Khaenri'ah](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Khaenri%27ah "Khaenri'ah")  
Not as if my destructive self were made to be the [lyre](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_Lyre_der_Himmel "Holy Lyre der Himmel") of [Barbatos](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Barbatos "Barbatos")  
Not as if I were to soar like a Pegasus  
Not if I were the swift, snow-white pair of Morphes  
Add these to the feather-footed and the winged  
And likewise, call for the swiftness of the winds  
And though you should harness these, friend, and offer them to me  
Yet I should be tired to the bone  
And worn away by frequent faintness  
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">My friend, while I would search for you  
The heavens fall to pieces  
And falsehoods collapse</mark>
