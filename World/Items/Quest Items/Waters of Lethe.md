**Waters of Lethe** is a Quest Item obtained during the World Quest [Lotus Eater](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Lotus_Eater "Lotus Eater").

Water from [a river that flows near the Evernight Temple](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tokoyo_Reisen "Tokoyo Reisen"). It shines with a faint light in the darkness. Directly ingesting this liquid will not cause you to forget anything, but the [[Dragonbone Orb]] created through its auspices has this effect.

### Trivia :
- The [River Lethe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethe "wikipedia:Lethe") is one of the five rivers of the underworld in Greek mythology. Drinking from it would cause forgetfulness, and the spirits of the dead would drink from it before being reincarnated.
