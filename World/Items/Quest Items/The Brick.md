The objects in the box are all pretty old. One particular sheet of paper stands out.

A piece of it has been burned away, and the remaining parts show signs of having been rescued from that same flame.

Every line on this sheet of paper has a matching one right under it. From the handwriting, it looks like a child wrote on this first before an adult stepped in, held their hand, and taught them how to do it the second time.

The writings are as follows: 

*"Remember always that it was the [[Alberich Clan]], who did not have royal blood, who stepped in as regents when the strength of the one-eyed king [[Irmin]] failed."
"Though we could not restore Khaenri'ah to life, we of the Alberich Clan should lead lives as those who blaze like fire, rather than those who wallow in the embers."*

If you flip the paper over, there are other words there. You reckon these must be annotations of some sort.

*"I saved this one memento from the fire 'Father' made while he wasn't paying attention. This was in violation of our principles. Our clan's affairs should never be recorded."
"For me, this sheet of paper cannot serve as any form of identification, and will not give me passage anywhere."
"Now that I look at it, his handwriting was as grieving as a smoking ash pile. There is no way that I can write something like that, living in Mondstadt as I am."*

Moving the paper aside, you can see a cloth bag underneath it that contains an eyepatch of significant age. A sticker is attached to the side, and the text on it reads:

*"Hah! To think that all that play-acting as a one-eyed pirate would eventually end with one actual wounded eye."
"I have never blamed Diluc for that. I suppose I must have been asking for it, [telling him the truth the day my adoptive father died](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kaeya/Lore#Vision "Kaeya/Lore") without expecting conflict to emerge somehow."
"He seems to believe that I really was blinded, though that's not the case. Well, I've fooled him for a while, haven't I? Might as well keep going."*

Two letters lie beneath the bag, all of which have "D" as their sender. The letters are in great condition, and there is a time written on the back. This is most likely the time these letters were received.

**Mysterious Box in a Secret Compartment:** You can tell that the words have been written in a strong but elegant hand.

	**Letter Addressed to "K" (I):** To K:
	**Letter Addressed to "K" (I):** Messaged received. Thank you.
	**Letter Addressed to "K" (I):** Also, I suggest that you stop mentioning eyes in your letters. Don't think that I don't know that your right eye wasn't blinded.

	**Letter Addressed to "K" (II):** To K:
	**Letter Addressed to "K" (II):** Thanks for the letter.
	**Letter Addressed to "K" (II):** Cooperating with the Knights has objective pros and cons, like two sides of a coin. I'm sure you understand that better than I do.
	**Letter Addressed to "K" (II):** No need to worry about my safety. Self-preservation is easy. Striving towards my goal is hard. Take better care of yourself instead.
	**Mysterious Box in a Secret Compartment:** A small paper bag lies next to these two letters. It contains nothing but a few seashells.
	**Mysterious Box in a Secret Compartment:** They have lost most of their luster. It is unclear how much time has passed since they were picked up.
