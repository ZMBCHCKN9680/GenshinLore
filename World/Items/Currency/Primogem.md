## Trivia

-   The word Primogem is likely a portmanteau of the words "primordial" and "gem."
-   The Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese term for Primogem is 原石 lit. "primordial stone." This term likely derives from the same usage of "primordial" as 原神 lit. "primordial god," the title of [the game](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact "Genshin Impact") as well as the term [Allogene](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Allogene "Allogene").
    -   This term can also literally mean "rough gemstone," but that definition is not likely related to its usage in the game.
