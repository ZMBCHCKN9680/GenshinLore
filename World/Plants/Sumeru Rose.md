Also known as Ley Line Lodestar

Bright and beautiful, these pure purple flowers give off a pleasant fragrance that will give any passerby pause. While some like to call this type of “rambler rose,” its relative lack of multiple flowers means that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">it falls under a different floral classification.</mark>

They're sensitive to Ley Lines and emit varying amounts of light in response. Excessive brightness indicates a dangerous level of Ley Line activity in the surrounding area.
