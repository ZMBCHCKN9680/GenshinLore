A flower that grows near water sources. When cooked, the petals have a chunky texture, yet are sweet and a little bitter.

### Trivia :
- Calla Lily is a common name for the real flowering plant [Zantedeschia aethiopica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zantedeschia_aethiopica "wikipedia:Zantedeschia aethiopica").
- According to [Noelle](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Noelle "Noelle")'s [Hangout Event](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hangout_Event "Hangout Event"), Calla Lilies have a calming effect.
- According to [[Lisa]], Calla Lilies are medicinal flowers with antidotal properties.
- Calla Lilies are also used for medicine in [Qingce Village](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Qingce_Village "Qingce Village").
- The author of [Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Pretty_Please,_Kitsune_Guuji%3F "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?") created the fictional drink [Rainbow Aster](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rainbow_Aster "Rainbow Aster"), which the character Yae Masako claims can cure a cold due to the combination of Calla Lilies and [Mint](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mint "Mint"). This drink was later made real as part of a collaboration between the novel and [Sailing Breeze](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sailing_Breeze "Sailing Breeze") and does use both Calla Lilies and Mint, but no remarks have been made on whether it has medicinal effects or not.
