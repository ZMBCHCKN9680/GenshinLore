The **Dark Sea** is a term that refers to any location beyond the continent of [Teyvat](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Teyvat "Teyvat"). Because they are not within Teyvat's boundaries, those who dwell there do not live under the dominion of [The Seven](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Seven "The Seven").

## Overview

Little is known about this area besides the fact that it is outside of Teyvat. Despite being called a "sea," this term also encompasses landmasses.

In the ancient past, parts of the land now known as the Dark Sea were inhabited by the [Seelie](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Seelie "Seelie"), who built palaces there. While some Seelie also dwell in Teyvat, their palaces are said to stand in the "wasteland" beyond the dominion of The Seven, which is "inhabited only by the grotesque ghostly remains of fallen [gods](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Gods "Gods")."

Following the end of the [Archon War](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Archon_War "Archon War") 2,000 years ago, many of the defeated gods who survived chose to flee to the Dark Sea instead of living under the new order of The Seven. However, it is suggested that the gods who fled have also died since then from reasons unknown.

[[Enkanomiya]] is referred to as part of the Dark Sea (despite being directly below [[Watatsumi]] and thus geographically within Teyvat's borders), as it is outside of the jurisdiction of [The Seven](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Seven "The Seven"). The "serpent god" [[Orobashi]] was worshipped by the people of Enkanomiya after saving the inhabitants from the [Dragonheirs of the Depths](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonheir_of_the_Depths "Dragonheir of the Depths"). Derived from information within the book "[[Before Sun and Moon]]" Enkanomiya's history extends to long before the dominion of The Seven, supposedly to a time when The Seven did not exist and "all of humanity was unified under a single culture". After Orobashi discovered this book and the secrets detailed within, he was sentenced to death by Celestia, presumably because Celestia does not want anyone to know that Celestia and the gods do not originate from Teyvat.

There may be other areas that meet the requirements of being labelled as the "Dark Sea", such as the [Haar Islands](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Apple_Archipelago "Golden Apple Archipelago") or [[Khaenri'ah]], but they are  never directly referred to as part of the Dark Sea.

## Notes

-   In [A Drunkard's Tale (III)](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/A_Drunkard%27s_Tale_(III) "A Drunkard's Tale (III)"), which makes reference to the Seelies and the wasteland "beyond the dominion of the deities," the original Chinese text is clearer that "deities" refers to The Seven, while "gods" refers to gods who preceded The Seven.
