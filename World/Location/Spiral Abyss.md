> A massive underground city constructed by an ancient civilization long gone. To this day, the purpose of this underground city remains unknown. Its structure is divided into the "Abyss Corridor," which connects worlds, and the "Abyssal Moon Spire," which leads to the unknown. It is now collectively called the "Spiral Abyss"... It is said that many secrets and treasures that have been long forgotten by this world lay buried within...
> Monsters and humans alike flock to the tower in search of the secrets and treasures it contains. Challenge different floors of the tower and defeat the enemies within to win Abyssal Stars. Do this, and the Spiral Abyss may yet look upon your hard work and bestow rewards upon you.

The **Spiral Abyss** is a special type of [Domain](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Domain "Domain") unlocked at [Adventure Rank](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Adventure_Rank "Adventure Rank") 20 located in [Musk Reef](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Musk_Reef "Musk Reef"), which can be accessed through the wormhole in the sky at the edge of [Cape Oath](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cape_Oath "Cape Oath").

The Spiral Abyss consists of two main parts: the Abyss Corridor (Floors 1–8) and the Abyssal Moon Spire (Floors 9–12). The Corridor's rewards can only be collected once, and completing all floors unlocks the Spire. The Spire's rewards reset on the 1st and 16th days of the month during the **Moment of Syzygy**. The period beginning on the 1st of every month is called the Waxing Phase while the period beginning on the 16th of every month is called the Waning Phase.

Players can view their current progress on their map, next to their resin count. If no Spiral Abyss challenge exists, it will say "This round's challenge has not yet begun".
