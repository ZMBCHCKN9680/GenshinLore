> Khaenri'ah was a nation without a god — not because it had a god that died or abandoned them, but because it never had a god to begin with. It was a powerful nation, built purely by humans, an unprecedented flourishing and glorious civilization — it was the pride of humankind.

**Khaenri'ah**, also known as the **Kingdom of Khaenri'ah**, is an unreleased region. It is not part of the continent of [Teyvat](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Teyvat "Teyvat") and is not under the purview of [The Seven](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Seven "The Seven"). It is also the location that the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler") first awoke upon entering Teyvat.

Khaenri'ah is most known for its role in the [cataclysm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm") 500 years ago. During this time, monsters created by the alchemist [[Rhinedottir]], also known as "Gold," poured out from Khaenri'ah to invade Teyvat, and Khaenri'ah was eventually destroyed by [Celestia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Celestia "Celestia") and the gods. Afterwards, many of its inhabitants were turned into the monsters that would eventually form the [[Abyss Order]]

Despite its destruction and the transformation of many of its people into monsters, Khaenri'ah is still inhabited by humans to this day. [[Dainsleif]] — a denizen of Khaenri'ah and the video's narrator — describes it as one of "the hidden corners where the gods' gaze does not fall," and says that its people "dream of dreaming," unlike the majority who are "content to live, and not to dream."
[Chapter ??](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_%3F%3F "Chapter ??"): The Dream Yet to Be Dreamed takes place in this region.

## Description

> Khaenri'ah was an underground realm, and its natural fauna were few indeed. As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life. This art of creation was known as "The Art of Khemia."

Khaenri'ah is dark underground and mostly barren of natural life. What little is currently known about Khaenri'ah largely comes from weapon and artifact descriptions, as well as books found throughout the world. According to [Dainsleif](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dainsleif "Dainsleif"), it is the "pride of humanity", as it was built purely by humans without involvement from any god, until later it was destroyed by the gods 500 years ago.

The practice of the [Art of Khemia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Art_of_Khemia "Art of Khemia") led to the Kingdom of Khaenri'ah's ruin. 500 years ago, in an event now referred to as the "cataclysm" or "catastrophe," the alchemist Gold's bottomless desire to create ever more powerful creatures led to the destruction of the [Eclipse Dynasty](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Eclipse_Dynasty "Eclipse Dynasty"), which ruled the Kingdom of Khaenri'ah. These monsters, along with the creatures corrupted by Gold — such as [[Durin]] — spewed forth from the fallen nation into the land of [Teyvat](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Teyvat "Teyvat").

[Mondstadt](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mondstadt "Mondstadt")'s [Knights of Favonius](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Knights_of_Favonius "Knights of Favonius"), then led by Grand Master [Arundolyn](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Arundolyn "Arundolyn"), led an expedition into Khaenri'ah to quell the monsters. His best friend and rival, [Rostam](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rostam "Rostam"), fell in battle during the cataclysm, leaving Arundolyn greatly bereaved. Other notable figures who are known for fighting against the monsters include [Viridescent](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Viridescent "Viridescent") and the [Crimson Witch of Flames](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Signora "Signora"). While the initial surge of monsters was eventually suppressed, hilichurls continue to spawn throughout Teyvat.

In the present, Khaenri'ah continues its struggle against the effects of the curse. [Kaeya](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kaeya "Kaeya"), their "last hope," was sent to Mondstadt for the sake of an "ancient plot," infiltrating the [Ragnvindr Clan](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ragnvindr_Clan "Ragnvindr Clan") by being abandoned at the [Dawn Winery](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dawn_Winery "Dawn Winery"). The ultimate reason behind Kaeya being placed as a "sleeper" in Mondstadt by forces from Khaenri'ah is unknown.

### Abyss Order

The Abyss Order originates from the destruction of Khaenri'ah by the gods; it seeks to destroy the countries under the protection of [The Seven](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Seven "The Seven") in revenge. The people of Khaenri'ah turned into the monsters of the Abyss. Thus, it is thought that [[Abyss Mage]], [[Abyss Herald]], and [[Abyss Lector]] were once people from Khaenri'ah, possibly its aristocracy and knights / defending people.

The Art of Khemia is an advanced type of [alchemy](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy") developed in Khaenri'ah which allows for the creation of life itself. Five hundred years ago, the Art of Khemia was a major contributing factor behind the [cataclysm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm") and the fall of Khaenri'ah.

The only known practitioners of the Art of Khemia are [Rhinedottir](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rhinedottir "Rhinedottir") and [Albedo](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Albedo "Albedo"), her student and successful attempt to create a synthetic human.

Code-named "Field Tillers" by the people of Khaenri'ah, [Ruin Machines](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ruin_Machines "Ruin Machines") were made as weapons of war by the people of Khaenri'ah. After the nation's downfall, the machines migrated across Teyvat. Though dangerous, they now lack any planned purpose.

## Khaenri'ahns

The people of Khaenri'ah were changed into creatures of the [[Abyss]] in the cataclysm that destroyed the dynasty 500 years as a result of the curse. Many were transformed into [hilichurls](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hilichurls "Hilichurls"); others became Abyss mages, heralds or lectors. The Black Serpent Knights were transformed into [[The Black Serpents|Shadowy Husks]].

However, some escaped this fate — one such is [Dainsleif](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dainsleif "Dainsleif") who instead was cursed with immortality for failing to protect the royal dynasty. Despite the transformation of most people of Khaenri'ah into monsters, some of them still retained their memories such as some hilichurls entering [The Chasm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chasm "The Chasm")'s underground, aware that the curse's effects no longer linger in that area, wanting to end their suffering once and for all and the likes of [Halfdan](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Halfdan "Halfdan"), who can still remember Dainsleif as the "Twilight Sword" despite being a Shadowy Husk himself.

[Kaeya](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kaeya "Kaeya")'s biological parents came from Khaenri'ah, but is unknown whether he lived in there before the cataclysm, or if he is only their descendant.

Other persons associated with the state include [Pierro](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Pierro "Pierro"), [Rhinedottir](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rhinedottir "Rhinedottir") and possibly [Albedo](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Albedo "Albedo") by extension.

### Etymology

-   Several elements of Khaenri'ah are most likely inspired by the [Germanic legends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_mythology "wikipedia:Germanic mythology"), particularly the [Nibelungen song](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibelungenlied "wikipedia:Nibelungenlied").
    -   Most characters related to Khaenri'ah are named after Germanic/Norse myth and literature:
        -   [Dainsleif](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dainsleif "Dainsleif") — [the name of a legendary sword](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A1insleif "wikipedia:Dáinsleif")
        -   Alberich ([Kaeya](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kaeya "Kaeya")'s surname) — [the name of a dwarven king](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberich "wikipedia:Alberich"), also appearing in Richard Wagner's Ring of the Nibelungen opera.
        -   [Durin](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Durin "Durin") and [Dvalin](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dvalin "Dvalin") — [the names of two dwarven smiths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durinn "wikipedia:Durinn")

    -   The battle between gods and god-like powers caused a catastrophe onto the world, and [Abyss Heralds](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Abyss_Heralds "Abyss Heralds") still preaches the burning and the end of the world. The concept resembles the event in the Norse mythology called "Fate of the Gods" (Old Norse: _[Ragnarök](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k "wikipedia:Ragnarök")_) or "Twilight of the Gods" (German: _Götterdämmerung_) in the Nibelungen song. The title of Dainsleif — "Twilight Sword" — shares a similar wording.
-   Khemia is phonetically similar to several etymological origins for the modern terms [alchemy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alchemy "wikipedia:alchemy") and [chemistry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chemistry "wikipedia:chemistry"). The origin of these terms are uncertain and multiple derivations exist.
    -   One possible derivation is from the Arabic [كيمياء](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%A1 "wiktionary:كيمياء") _kīmiyāʾ_, "chemistry", which comes from Coptic term [ⲕⲏⲙⲉ](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E2%B2%95%E2%B2%8F%E2%B2%99%E2%B2%89 "wiktionary:ⲕⲏⲙⲉ") _kēme_, "Egypt". The Coptic term ultimately derives from the ancient Egyptian word [𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%93%86%8E%F0%93%85%93%F0%93%8F%8F%F0%93%8A%96 "wiktionary:𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖") _kmt_, referring to both the country Egypt and the color black.
    -   Other possible derivations are from the Ancient Greek [χημεία](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%87%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%B1 "wiktionary:χημεία") _khēmeía_ meaning "pouring" or "infusion," or the Ancient Greek metallurgical term [χυμεία](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%87%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%B1 "wiktionary:χυμεία") _khumeía_ originally meaning "pouring together," "casting together," "weld," or "alloy."
    -   In Arabic, "alchemy" translates to [خيمياء](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AE%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%A1 "wiktionary:خيمياء") _ḵīmiyāʾ_.
-   Khaenri'ah's motto, "The land is [...] to be fought for with steel and blood", is likely to be a reference to "with iron and blood" (German: _durch Eisen und Blut_), a famous phrase used during the [Blood and Iron Speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_and_Iron_(speech) "wikipedia:Blood and Iron (speech)") made by the Prussian minister president [Otto von Bismarck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck "wikipedia:Otto von Bismarck") in 1862.
    -   While the English version uses the wording "with steel and blood", the Chinese one uses "with iron and blood" (Chinese: 用铁和血) that exactly matches the wording of the historical speech.
-   In [Sumeru](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sumeru "Sumeru"), _Dahri_ is an archaic name for Khaenri'ah that's commonly used in the [Vahumana](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Vahumana "Vahumana") [Darshan](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Darshan "Darshan"). The Arabic-Persian word "dahri" (Arabic: دَهْرِيّ _dahriyy_; Persian: دهری _dahrī_), derived from _dahr_ (Arabic-Persian: [دَهْر](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AF%D9%87%D8%B1#Noun "wiktionary:دهر"), "the course of time, fate"), is a theological term which refers to an atheist, or an adherent of the doctrine that the universe has no beginning in time. The term has been used in different ways in Middle Persian and Islamic writings, but generally, _dahri_ deny the existence of a creator god and believe that the world exists eternally in time.
