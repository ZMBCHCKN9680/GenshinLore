## Overview

The Abyss' "unworldly" power is diametrically opposed to the Light Realm's and can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">corrupt</mark> entities from the Human Realm, which are under [Celestia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Celestia "Celestia")'s dominion. The Void Realm's dark currents are analogous to the Human Realm's [Ley Lines](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ley_Lines "Ley Lines") and the Light Realm's elemental currents. Its darkness is extremely harmful towards elemental beings such as Vishaps and elemental dragons, although they are capable of repelling the darkness by harnessing the Light Realm's power.

The Abyss' darkness is described as the only kind of power that could dye [Morax](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Morax "Morax")'s stone pillars black. [Venti](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Venti "Venti"), another [Archon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Archon "Archon"), was poisoned by [[Durin]]'s abyss-laced blood when his attempt to connect with [Dvalin](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dvalin "Dvalin") was interrupted by the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler"); only by visiting the [Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Symbol_of_Mondstadt%27s_Hero "Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero") at [Windrise](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Windrise "Windrise") could Venti expunge the abyssal poison from himself. The rest of Durin's blood was spilt in [[Dragonspine]], where it crystallized into [[Crimson Agate]], <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a substance capable of reviving the [Frostbearing Tree](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Frostbearing_Tree "Frostbearing Tree"), which died thousands of years ago after the [Skyfrost Nail](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Skyfrost_Nail "Skyfrost Nail") dropped from Celestia. Previous attempts to revive the tree failed, indicating that Durin's blood had special properties.</mark>

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Prolonged exposure to the Abyss can drastically change a person's personality or corrupt their entire being. The Abyss appears to be attracted to — and draws in — those with great ambition, such as [Gold](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Gold "Gold") and Tartaglia. Those who have personal ties to the Abyss have been known to gain an uncanny ability to wreak havoc and conflict. Tsumi believes that the Abyss Order finds the Void Realm's power addictive.</mark>

Denizens of the Abyss appear to use an [Enochian-based language](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Languages#Enochian-Based_Language "Languages"), based on the text that can be seen above [[Abyss Mage]]' heads when talking to [hilichurls](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hilichurls "Hilichurls") and in their [Adventurer Handbook](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer_Handbook "Adventurer Handbook") description. Abyss monsters also have the ability to manipulate elemental energy without the use of [Visions](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Vision "Vision").

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Time in the Abyss passes differently than it does in Teyvat;</mark> [Tartaglia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tartaglia "Tartaglia") spent three months in there, but returned to a Teyvat that had only seen three days pass since his disappearance. When [Takamine the Mistsplitter](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Takamine_the_Mistsplitter "Takamine the Mistsplitter") finally emerged from the Abyss, a long time had passed on Teyvat and [Asase Hibiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Asase_Hibiki "Asase Hibiki") was "no longer young." It is unclear whether this time scale disparity is consistent, or if it can change depending on certain factors.

## [[Abyss Order]]
The Abyss Order is an organization comprised mostly of non-human beings that harness both the elements and abyssal power, seeking to ruin Teyvat as retaliation for the [cataclysm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm") 500 years ago. Its members are former citizens of Khaenri'ah who were transformed into monsters through a yet unclear process. After being separated by the [Unknown God](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Unknown_God "Unknown God"), the [Traveler's Sibling](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler%27s_Sibling "Traveler's Sibling") has also become the leader of the Abyss Order. The Abyss Order usually conscripts [Hilichurls](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hilichurls "Hilichurls") to do their work.

## Story

### Ancient History

According to legend, before the [[The Primordial One]] descended on the world, the elemental Light Realm and the abyssal Void Realm existed in diametric opposition to each other. The Primordial One created the Human Realm after defeating the [[Seven Sovereigns]] of the Light Realm, subjugating both nature and those of the Light Realm who hadn't escaped into the ocean.

During the war between the Primordial One and the [Second Who Came](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Who_Came "Second Who Came"), the region of [[Enkanomiya]] fell into the ocean depths, where the forces of the Light Realm and the Void Realm already existed. With the addition of a Human Realm aspect, the Vishaps who had fled into the oceans grew hostile towards the stranded people and were only fended off through the creation of the [Dainichi Mikoshi](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dainichi_Mikoshi "Dainichi Mikoshi") and later, the intervention of the god [[Orobashi]]. The people of Enkanomiya built the Towers of the Three Realms to regulate the powers of the Human Realm, Light Realm, and Void Realm. These towers, known as [Kunado's Locus](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kunado%27s_Locus "Kunado's Locus"), [Yachimatahiko's Locus](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Yachimatahiko%27s_Locus "Yachimatahiko's Locus"), and [Yachimatahime's Locus](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Yachimatahime%27s_Locus "Yachimatahime's Locus"), were hidden using techniques only known by shrine maidens and the Vassals of Watatsumi.

### The Cataclysm

Five hundred years ago, during the [cataclysm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm"), the fall of [Khaenri'ah](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Khaenri%27ah "Khaenri'ah")'s [[Eclipse Dynasty]]. came at the hands of the gods. The "great sinner" [[Rhinedottir]], also known as Gold, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">created an enormous amount of monsters containing abyssal power</mark>. These monsters proceeded to ravage Teyvat, causing widespread destruction. It is unclear whether the gods' attack on Khaenri'ah came before or after her actions, but the two events are inextricably linked. Following the gods' attack on Khaenri'ah, some of the people of Khaenri'ah were transformed into monsters through a curse. [[Dainsleif]], despite being a royal guard of Khaenri'ah who was cursed with immortality himself, somehow was not converted into an Abyss monster and instead opposes the Abyss Order.

### Present

When [Tartaglia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tartaglia "Tartaglia") was fourteen, he ran away from home, and after falling into a deep hole, he found himself in the Abyss. There, he encountered a swordswoman, likely the one named [[Skirk]], who trained him, taught him to navigate the Abyss, and<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> nurtured his ability to raise endless conflict no matter where he went.</mark>

After the Traveler retrieves the [Bloodbranch Coral](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Bloodbranch_Coral "Bloodbranch Coral") so [Sangonomiya Kokomi](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sangonomiya_Kokomi "Sangonomiya Kokomi") could perform the [Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Watatsumi_Goryou_Matsuri "Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri"), a ritual used to reverse Watatsumi Island's Holy Soil phenomenon. However, unexpectedly, the phenomenon failed to reverse and merely halted. Concerned, the Divine Priestess sent a team to investigate, only to discover that Enkanomiya was shrouded in a mysterious darkness. This darkness turned out to be the encroachment of the Void Realm, instigated by [Enjou](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Enjou "Enjou"), who convinced the Bathysmal Vishaps to disrupt the Towers of the Three Realms in favor of the Void Realm. The vishaps, eager to overthrow human presence, complied, only to discover that they were even more susceptible to abyssal power. [Tsumi](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tsumi "Tsumi") went to the Watatsumi troops in the guise of a shrine maiden to aid in repelling the Void Realm, rescue the vishaps trapped under the Dainichi Mikoshi, and perhaps even destroy the tower. Although she succeeds in her former two goals, she ultimately finds herself unable to carry through with her last objective.

## Trivia

### Etymology

-   In both English and Chinese, the term "abyss" (Chinese: 深渊 _Shēnyuān_, lit. "deep abyss"), can refer to a literal bottomless (or unfathomably deep) pit, or used in a figurative sense to refer to a catastrophic or destructive situation.
-   The Chinese name for the Void Realm is 虚无界, which is similar to but distinct from the "Void" used in [[Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records]], which is 虚空. As adjectives, both can mean "empty" or "void," but as nouns, [虚无](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%99%9B%E7%84%A1#Chinese "wiktionary:虛無") means "nothingness" whereas [虛空](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%99%9B%E7%A9%BA#Chinese "wiktionary:虛空") means "empty space" or "sky."
