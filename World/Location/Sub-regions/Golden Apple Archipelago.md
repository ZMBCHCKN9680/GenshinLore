The **Golden Apple Archipelago** is a limited time summer event area located east of [Mondstadt](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mondstadt "Mondstadt") that first appeared in [Version 1.6](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Version_1.6 "Version 1.6") and appeared again in [Version 2.8](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Version_2.8 "Version 2.8") in the [Summertime Odyssey](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Summertime_Odyssey "Summertime Odyssey") event with a different look. It was historically known as the **Haar Islands** before the events of [Midsummer Island Adventure](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Midsummer_Island_Adventure "Midsummer Island Adventure"). This area contains a set of islands that the [Dodo-King](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dodo-King "Dodo-King") invited [Klee](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Klee "Klee") to in the quest [Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mysterious_Islands:_Journey_to_the_Unknown "Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown").

The archipelago is the first location released where the player can be introduced to the [Waverider](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Waverider "Waverider") [system](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Systems "Game Systems").

Many of the archipelago's elements have later reappeared at [Inazuma](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Inazuma "Inazuma").


## History

> These islands are isolated from the outside world, like a secret Domain crafted by nature itself.

According to [Venti](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Venti "Venti"), the archipelago used to be called the **Haar Islands**. The islands were created during the terraforming of [Mondstadt](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mondstadt "Mondstadt"); as [Barbatos](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Barbatos "Barbatos") reshaped the region, he split off the tops from mountains which then landed upside-down in the sea, becoming the archipelago. Lisa also mentions it "belonging to no nation", likely meaning it is located in neutral waters.

The area appears to be operated by an unusually large mechanism that has not yet been revealed. Initially, the islands were covered in dense fog, which made travel to the islands extremely dangerous and inaccessible to most. This, along with the changing tides and winds, also made it difficult to escape once anyone made it to the islands. While [hilichurls](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hilichurls "Hilichurls") can be found on the archipelago both before and after the islands' rising, it is unknown if the hilichurls had been there first or somehow sailed to it.

Civilization began on the Haar Islands with one shipwrecked group that lived on the archipelago for many generations. Many people tried escaping; it remains unknown if any of them were successful. Around 500 years later, [Ako Domeki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ako_Domeki "Ako Domeki") and his pirate fleet were shipwrecked on the island after [Asase Hibiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Asase_Hibiki "Asase Hibiki") unleashed a [Thunder Manifestation](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Thunder_Manifestation "Thunder Manifestation") during a battle between his and the Shogunate's forces on [Seirai Island](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Seirai_Island "Seirai Island"). Domeki's fleet also included a stolen [samurai puppet](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Maguu_Kenki "Maguu Kenki") that protected the islanders until it was damaged and rendered inactive. Then, with the help of the pirates, an escape route was devised that took advantage of the archipelago's unusual features. As it seemed likely that the escape route would work, everyone left the islands. It is not known what happened to the local inhabitants. However, Domeki and his fleet returned to Seirai Island, which was now in ruins.

Some years after the archipelago became abandoned, the events of [Midsummer Island Adventure](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Midsummer_Island_Adventure "Midsummer Island Adventure") occurred in the present day. [Klee](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Klee "Klee") received a letter from "[Dodo-King](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dodo-King "Dodo-King")" threatening to take Dodoco away from her unless she could prove herself. With the assistance of the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler") and [Paimon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Paimon "Paimon"), Klee was able to find the location of the archipelago as well as the means to get there, with Acting Grand Master [Jean](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Jean "Jean") and Deaconess [Barbara](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Barbara "Barbara") also deciding to come with her for her safety. The five were taken to the archipelago by [Dvalin](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dvalin "Dvalin"), summoned by Venti. There they would begin looking for "Dodo-King" and learn about the archipelago's mysterious history in the process.

The group is eventually joined by [Kaeya](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kaeya "Kaeya"), [Diluc](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Diluc "Diluc"), [Albedo](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Albedo "Albedo"), and [Razor](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Razor "Razor"), who were also flown to the archipelago by Dvalin but became separated when Razor jumped off mid-flight. Each also received a letter from Dodo-King with varying, personal messages catered to their concerns, causing everyone to become wary of the true identity of Dodo-King.

After solving the mystery, it is revealed that [Alice](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Alice "Alice"), Klee's mother, had brought the group to the archipelago so she could ensure that her daughter had a memorable summer vacation. She had visited the area before and found the scenery and history beautiful and spent some time dressing up the islands for her daughter's enjoyment.

### The Archon War (?–2000 Years ago)

-   **<2600 years ago** ― [Minacious Isle](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Minacious_Isle "Minacious Isle") travels from [Mondstadt](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mondstadt "Mondstadt") to [Haar Islands](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Apple_Archipelago "Golden Apple Archipelago"), having been broken off of a mountain and turned upside down after Barbatos terraforms [Mondstadt](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mondstadt "Mondstadt"). With it comes a Seelie.

### Post-Minacious Isle Formation

-   **<2600 years ago** ― After Minacious Isle is formed, a group of people gets shipwrecked there, including a grandmother with a family heirloom from her hometown. These people go on to live across the archipelago for at least five generations.
    -   The speakers of [Conch Retrospection I: Songs of a Distant Home](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Echoing_Tales/Story "Echoing Tales/Story") (Five Mountains, Two Paths, One River, Four Winds, and Clan of Song) span a _minimum_ of four generations starting with the grandchild of the first grandmother (the addressee and speaker, respectively, in Five Mountains), or five when including the first grandmother. It is unknown how many generations are not represented by the Echoing Conches. The _tightest_ plausible timeline is as follows:
        -   Let Person Z be the speaker of Five Mountains. Her grandchild, who she speaks to in Five Mountains, is Person A. Person A is from generation #1.
        -   The speaker of Two Paths could be Person A (generation #1), now grown. She could be referring to herself as "Mommy" in third person, because she may be addressing her child. She speaks to Person B, who would be from generation #2.
        -   The speaker of One River, "Grandma," could be Person B (generation #2), now grown. She speaks to Person C, who would be from generation #4.
        -   The speaker of Four Winds could be Person C (generation #4), still a child.
        -   The "Mother" in Clan of Song is likely not the speaker of One River, as while they both sound elderly, they have different voices. She could be the mother between Person B (generation #2) and Person C (generation #4), which would make her from generation #3. This would also make the other speaker in Clan of Song Person C (generation #4), now grown.
-   **500 years ago** ― A pirate crew from a Shogun-ruled Inazuma is separated when their boat splits in half. One group gets shipwrecked on the [Nameless Island](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Isle#Nameless_Island "Broken Isle") between [Broken Isle](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Isle "Broken Isle") and [Twinning Isle](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Twinning_Isle "Twinning Isle"), while the other group drifts southeast until they end up [southeast of Twinning Isle](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Twinning_Isle#Southeast_Islands "Twinning Isle"). The pirates lose all of their treasure except for a [samurai puppet](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Maguu_Kenki "Maguu Kenki") that they stole, which is later relocated to the [Central Platform](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Central_Platform "Central Platform").
-   **500 years ago** ― The pirates and islanders figure out a way to get off the archipelago.
