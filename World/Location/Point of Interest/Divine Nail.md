The **divine nails**, also referred to with a variety of terms such as **needles**, **pillars**, and **spikes**, are large objects resembling broken crystalline pillars found scattered in ancient ruins across [Teyvat](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Teyvat "Teyvat"). These nails contain immense power and are capable of affecting the [Ley Lines](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ley_Line "Ley Line") in the areas where they are located.

According to various legends, they were cast down by the [[The Primordial One]] to heal the land following the war between it and the [Second Who Came](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Who_Came "Second Who Came"), but they also devastated the mortal realm.

## Overview

So far, the divine nails have all taken the form of a broken pillar with a seemingly stone exterior, with a blue crystalline interior revealed through its broken end and the decorative motifs around the nail. At the top of the nail is a [celestial motif](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Symbols_in_Teyvat#Celestial_Motif "Symbols in Teyvat").

At [[Dragonspine]] and [The Chasm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chasm "The Chasm"), people who have undertaken research into the areas' strange environments have noted peculiarities of similar qualities, which relate back to the power of the divine nails. Dragonspine, which was once a lush mountain, has blue plants that proliferate around [Ancient Rime](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient_Rime "Ancient Rime"). The Chasm, which is known for its ore, began spawning [Lumenstone](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Lumenstone "Lumenstone") and [Lumenspar](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Lumenspar "Lumenspar") after a fragment of its divine nail was discovered in one of the underground mines' caves. These stones are capable of repelling [Dark Mud](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Mud "Dark Mud"), an Abyssal power, which also began emerging en masse after the discovery of the nail fragment.

## Story

Thousands of years ago, a war between the Primordial One and the Second Who Came caused the destruction of heaven and earth. In the aftermath, the Primordial One cast down the divine nails to mend the land and suppress the "dark poison" — highly implied to relate to the secrets of the skies and the abyss — that the invaders had brought. However, this also had devastating effects on the civilizations that still existed on the mortal realm.

### Dragonspine

[Sal Vindagnyr](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sal_Vindagnyr "Sal Vindagnyr"), which was located on the mountain now known as Dragonspine, was once a lush and verdant area with a prominent [Irminsul](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Irminsul "Irminsul") tree which the people revered. When the [Skyfrost Nail](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Skyfrost_Nail "Skyfrost Nail") descended, it landed over a ritual site at the summit of the mountain, now known as the [Peak of Vindagnyr](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Peak_of_Vindagnyr "Peak of Vindagnyr"). It not only froze the area over but also shattered the Irminsul tree, which the [Princess of Sal Vindagnyr](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Princess_of_Sal_Vindagnyr "Princess of Sal Vindagnyr") attempted to revive via grafting but failed to accomplish.For unknown reasons, the Skyfrost Nail splintered into shards which then scattered to three places around Dragonspine, one of which was the Irminsul.

Around a thousand years ago, towards the end of the [Mondstadt Aristocracy](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mondstadt_Aristocracy "Mondstadt Aristocracy") era, a group of nobles attempted to restore their prestige by arranging an expedition to uncover Dragonspine's secrets. However, this expedition was sabotaged by [Eberhart](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Eberhart "Eberhart"), who wished to overthrow the aristocracy, and none of its members made it back to Mondstadt.

By the time the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler") explores Dragonspine, nobody had yet reached the summit on account of the Ancient Rime that blocked the paths to the summit. Over the course of _[In the Mountains](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/In_the_Mountains "In the Mountains")_, the Traveler frees the three shards from their icy encasements, which causes them to return to the main fragment at the summit. Each time, the jagged ice around the fragments also recedes into the earth after freeing the shards. After reaching the summit and thawing out the shards again, the nail is restored. The ice around the nail recedes and the nail ascends to the sky, revealing the Peak of Vindagnyr.

### The Chasm

The Chasm's [Spiritstone](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Spiritstone "Spiritstone") has an unknown relationship to the [Solar Chariot](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Solar_Chariot "Solar Chariot"), also known as the "heavenly star," legend known to the people of Liyue, and little is revealed regarding the civilization in the depths of The Chasm besides the fact that it is older than [[Khaenri'ah]].

In recent times, a fragment of the Spiritstone was discovered in [Stony Halls](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Stony_Halls "Stony Halls"), where miners who came in contact with it would begin having hallucinations in which their desires were granted, leading to this crystal to be dubbed the "Wishstone." Lumenstone and Lumenspar also began appearing en masse, while the physical structure of The Chasm's mines began changing as though alive. Alarmed by these turns of events, the [Liyue Qixing](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Liyue_Qixing "Liyue Qixing") ordered the closure of The Chasm and made an agreement with the [Fatui](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Fatui "Fatui") to investigate the cause.[_citation needed_] Following the events of [Archon Quest](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Archon_Quest "Archon Quest") [Chapter I](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_I "Chapter I"), this agreement was annulled and the Qixing decided to lead their own investigation.

Over the course of _[The Chasm Delvers](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chasm_Delvers "The Chasm Delvers")_, the Traveler and the [Chasm Exploration Team](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Chasm_Exploration_Team "Chasm Exploration Team") investigate the source of the anomalies in the mines. After freeing the Wishstone and following trails left behind by the Fatui [Ninth Company](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ninth_Company "Ninth Company")'s investigations, the Traveler makes their way to the Spiritstone, where they found it being bound by Abyssal power. Releasing the Spiritstone caused a Khaenri'ahn automaton, Haftvad the Worm, to emerge, which was only defeated after [Yelan](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Yelan "Yelan") dislodged the Spiritstone and crushed the Ruin Serpent underneath it. After Haftvad's destruction, the Spiritstone floated back up, albeit to a lower altitude than before.

During _[Perilous Trail](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Perilous_Trail "Perilous Trail")_, a group consisting of the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler"), [Paimon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Paimon "Paimon"), [Arataki Itto](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Arataki_Itto "Arataki Itto"), [Kuki Shinobu](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kuki_Shinobu "Kuki Shinobu"), [Yanfei](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Yanfei "Yanfei"), and Yelan fall into the space underneath the Spiritstone. There, they discovered that the domain it was connected to had a mysterious property which completely annihilated the power of the Abyss, but also doomed the [Millelith](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Millelith "Millelith") soldiers and the [Yaksha](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Yaksha "Yaksha") [Bosacius](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Bosacius "Bosacius") who had willingly sealed themselves in there to destroy the Abyssal threat during the [cataclysm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm").

### Eternal Oasis

In [Sumeru](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sumeru "Sumeru"), a divine nail was allegedly responsible for its desertification. According to legend, [King Deshret](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/King_Deshret "King Deshret") found the divine nail and established the [Eternal Oasis](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Eternal_Oasis "Eternal Oasis") there, building a mausoleum for the [Goddess of Flowers](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Goddess_of_Flowers "Goddess of Flowers") using the gems located under the sands and the power of the [Jinn](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Jinn "Jinn").
