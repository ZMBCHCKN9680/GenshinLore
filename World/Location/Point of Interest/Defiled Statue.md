It is a [Statue of The Seven](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Statue_of_The_Seven "Statue of The Seven") found along with an [Abyss Herald](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Abyss_Herald "Abyss Herald") in the ruins around [Mt.

## Profile

The Defiled Statue was originally a Statue of the Seven devoted to [Barbatos](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Barbatos "Barbatos"). However, it was eventually stolen in an unknown incident, after which [Mondstadt](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mondstadt "Mondstadt")'s people began telling stories about **The Lost Statue of the Seven**.]

Unlike the other statues, it is hung upside down by chains and the elemental object in its hands has been corrupted and surging with abyssal energy. The [Abyss Order](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Abyss_Order "Abyss Order") tasked an [Abyss Herald](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Abyss_Herald "Abyss Herald") with protecting the statue from interlopers.

Sometime after [Osial](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Osial "Osial") was defeated, a group of [Treasure Hoarders](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Treasure_Hoarders "Treasure Hoarders") banded together to distract the Abyss Order while sending a single thief, the [Grand Thief](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Thief "Grand Thief"), to infiltrate and steal any valuables. Due to untold circumstances, although possibly because of the Abyss Herald who was tasked with guarding the statue, the Grand Thief met his demise. The statue and the Grand Thief's kneeling corpse would later be discovered by the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler") and [Paimon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Paimon "Paimon").

Later, [Dainsleif](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dainsleif "Dainsleif") decodes a talisman from an [Abyss Mage](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Abyss_Mage "Abyss Mage"), concluding that the Order planned to use the Defiled Statue to create a mechanized god. They would replace the core the statue usually held with the eye of the first [Field Tiller](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Field_Tiller "Field Tiller") and then attach [Osial](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Osial "Osial")'s limbs to the arms of the statue. This way, they would create a machine to "topple the divine thrones of Celestia".

Dainsleif then plans to destroy the inverted statue to prevent the Abyss Order from creating their mechanized weapon. When they return to the ruins, the Traveler meets their sibling in front of the inverted statue.
