#Abyss 

![[Defiled_Statue.webp|800]]

**Abyssal corruption** is a generic term for entities which have fallen under the [[Abyss]]' influence. Such entities have a negative effect on the world of [Teyvat](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Teyvat "Teyvat").

## Overview

The Abyss holds the power of the [Void Realm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Void_Realm "Void Realm"), which is diametrically opposed to the powers of the [Light Realm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Realm "Light Realm") and the [Human Realm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Human_Realm "Human Realm"), the latter of which the surface world of Teyvat belongs to. As a result, surges of the Abyss' power have catastrophic consequences for Teyvat and humanity. The [cataclysm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm") 500 years ago is currently the most notable surge of Abyssal power; it was caused by an attack by monsters of [[Khaenri'ah]], which were created from the Abyss' powers. Following the aftermath of Khaenri'ah's destruction, some of the humans-turned-monsters became members of the [[Abyss Order]], who are capable of spreading Abyssal corruption.

Prolonged contact with Abyssal corruption causes negative physical and mental consequences. Physical ailments include a worsening cough which will eventually result in coughing up blood and eventually, one's innards. Hallucinations, visions, and insanity have also resulted from contact with Abyssal corruption, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">and prolonged exposure can drastically alter a person's personality by exacerbating their desires.</mark>

### Purification

Abyssal corruption can be purified or controlled through various means. Destroying sources of Abyssal corruption, depending on the entities' strength, can either permanently or temporarily halt their effects. The [Fatui](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Fatui "Fatui") developed the Mokosh Device, a machine capable of clearing Abyssal corruption up to a certain degree.

The power of [Celestia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Celestia "Celestia") can repel Abyssal corruption, and holding a connection to the [elements](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Element "Element") — whether through bearing a [Vision](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Vision "Vision") or some other means — provides greater resistance against the effects of Abyssal corruption. [Venti](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Venti "Venti") visits the [Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Symbol_of_Mondstadt%27s_Hero "Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero"), which allegedly grew where [Vennessa](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Vennessa "Vennessa") ascended to Celestia and holds the power of [Anemo](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Anemo "Anemo"), to recover from the Abyssal corruption which poisoned him when he attempted to break the curse over [[Dvalin]]. In [The Chasm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chasm "The Chasm"), the unearthing of a [Chasm Nail](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Chasm_Nail "Chasm Nail") fragment caused both the Abyssal [Dark Mud](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Mud "Dark Mud") and the mysterious [Lumenstones](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Lumenstone "Lumenstone") and [Lumenspar](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Lumenspar "Lumenspar") to begin growing en masse throughout the mines.) The [Lumenstone Adjuvant](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Lumenstone_Adjuvant "Lumenstone Adjuvant"), a particularly large Lumenstone which can be further enhanced by Lumenstones and Lumenspar, is capable of clearing out [Dark Mud](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Mud "Dark Mud").

For reasons yet to be explained, the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler") was capable of purifying the Abyssal corruption in one of [Dvalin](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dvalin "Dvalin")'s teardrops; by comparison, [Lisa](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa "Lisa") felt a rejection from the tear that took the form of a sharp stinging sensation.

## Notable Occurrences

The following are notable forms of Abyssal corruption which the Traveler has faced or has otherwise learned about.

### Tainted Blood

Monsters from [[Khaenri'ah]], most of which were created by the alchemist "Gold" [[Rhinedottir]], have blood tainted by the power of the Abyss. This otherworldly power can have lingering effects when spilled on Teyvat soil; after the demon dragon [[Durin]] was slain over [[Dragonspine]], its blood seeped into the land and revitalized the [[Frostbearing Tree]], as well as crystallized into [[Crimson Agate]] which can then be offered to the tree and allow it to grow. This growth defies the power of the [Skyfrost Nail](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Skyfrost_Nail "Skyfrost Nail"), which caused the land of Dragonspine to freeze over several thousand years ago and led to the collapse of the ancient civilization [Sal Vindagnyr](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sal_Vindagnyr "Sal Vindagnyr").

During his battle against Durin, [[Dvalin]] also ingested some of its blood after killing it with a fatal bite to its neck. The poisoned blood and the wounds he suffered over the course of the battle inflicted great suffering, which the Abyss Order took advantage of after his reawakening 500 years later to pit him against [Barbatos](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Barbatos "Barbatos"). When Barbatos, in the form of Venti, initially attempted to purify Dvalin, the Traveler and [Paimon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Paimon "Paimon") unintentionally interrupted them, causing the attempt to fail and getting Venti himself poisoned in turn.

### Defiled Statue

The Defiled Statue is a [Statue of The Seven](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Statue_of_The_Seven "Statue of The Seven") in [Barbatos](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Barbatos "Barbatos")' image, which was somehow plundered from [Mondstadt](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mondstadt "Mondstadt") by the Abyss Order as part of a project known as the Loom of Fate. The Abyss Order intended on using the Defiled Statue, the power of the ancient god [Osial](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Osial "Osial"), and the core of the [First Field Tiller](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Weird_Statue "Weird Statue") to create a weapon capable of destroying Celestia. Because of [[Dainsleif]] and the Traveler's intervention, this project is currently at a standstill, although the Defiled Statue's fate has been left unaddressed.

### Dark Mud

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gensin-impact/images/5/5a/Dark_Mud.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220321031105)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gensin-impact/images/5/5a/Dark_Mud.png/revision/latest?cb=20220321031105)

The discovery of a fragment of the Chasm Nail resulted in a surge of Abyssal corruption, primarily in the form of Dark Mud. The power of the Abyss in The Chasm appears to be at "war" with the power of Celestia, which also surged after the discovery of the fragment; [Khedive](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Khedive "Khedive") likens humanity as being "akin to beans on a stone mill, on the brink of a clash between two great powers. [...] we are presently being crushed by these two forces — one from above and one from below — and we shall soon be turned into bean paste!"

### Miasmic Tumor

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gensin-impact/images/4/40/Enemy_Miasmic_Tumor.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20210724060228)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gensin-impact/images/4/40/Enemy_Miasmic_Tumor.png/revision/latest?cb=20210724060228)

The "Miasmic Tumor"

The ["Miasmic Tumor"](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/%22Miasmic_Tumor%22 ""Miasmic Tumor"") was the accumulation of filth absorbed by the [Sacred Sakura](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sacred_Sakura "Sacred Sakura"), which was created by [Raiden Makoto](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Raiden_Makoto "Raiden Makoto") and planted by [Raiden Ei](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Raiden_Ei "Raiden Ei") to dampen the effects of Khaenri'ah's attack during the cataclysm on [Inazuma](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Inazuma "Inazuma").

During the events of _[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sacred_Sakura_Cleansing_Ritual "Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual")_, the Traveler helps the shrine maiden [Hanachirusato](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hanachirusato "Hanachirusato") — who was actually a resurgence of filth herself, formed from the memories of the deceased [Kitsune Saiguu](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kitsune_Saiguu "Kitsune Saiguu") — perform a major cleansing on the Sacred Sakura's roots and purge the "Miasmic Tumor."

## Trivia

-   During the commission _[Big Pudgy Problem!](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Pudgy_Problem! "Big Pudgy Problem!")_, the Traveler finds a strange location with concentrated purple elemental dust. Dispersing the elemental dust causes a large number of [Slimes](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Slimes "Slimes") to spawn, and Paimon afterwards remarks that there was "something spooky about those weird elemental traces." While this elemental dust has not been linked to Abyssal corruption, purple has been strongly connected to the Abyss when used outside of the context of Electro.
    -   This purple elemental dust is also seen on certain Statues of The Seven during the commissions _[Grateful to the Gods](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Grateful_to_the_Gods "Grateful to the Gods")_, in which Slimes may spawn after dispersing the dust. The elemental dust is noted to be brimming with elemental energy and possibly contain something that Slimes are drawn to.

### Etymology

-   The Mokosh Device (Russian: Система "Мокошь" "'Mokosh' System"), which the Fatui use to absorb and contain Abyssal corruption, is named after the Slavic goddess [Mokosh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokosh "wikipedia:Mokosh"), a Mother Goddess and the protector of women's work and women's destinies.
