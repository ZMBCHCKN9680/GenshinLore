## History

The Withering was introduced as a result of [King Deshret](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/King_Deshret "King Deshret") introducing forbidden knowledge to his people, causing the land around them to become weakened and affecting all who would wander into one. This disaster was temporarily halted by [Greater Lord Rukkhadevata](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Greater_Lord_Rukkhadevata "Greater Lord Rukkhadevata"), although she had lost significant power and was reduced to the size of a child as a result.

While beings can survive in a Withering Zone, the effects are extremely harmful to humans, who require a [Vision](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Vision "Vision") to simply resist its power. Even a brief exposure could cause serious effects, most notably [Eleazar](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Eleazar "Eleazar"), the manifestation of the Withering on humans.

Withering Zones are initially created as a Nascent Zone which attracts a small amount of monsters and begins to corrupt the surrounding area. These nascent zones are too young to form Fetid Boughs and Withering Branches and thus can be removed once all the monsters are killed. If they manage to persist, then they begin to form both, grow larger into a tumor, have a larger area of effect and begin to affect people.

The [Aranara](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Aranara "Aranara") call the Withering _Marana_, which is likely derived from the Sanskrit word _maraṇa_ (Sanskrit: मरण) meaning "death" or "killing". They say that Marana has the power to turn _Vana_ (forest) into _Valuka_ (desert). The Withering is also known as The Black Tide.

The Withering re-emerged during the [Cataclysm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm"), causing Rukkhadevata to sacrifice herself in order to prevent it from spreading rapidly across Sumeru. Cases of the Withering lowered, but it continued spreading all across Sumeru due to her taint in [Irminsul](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Irminsul "Irminsul") to the point that they were appearing faster than the [Forest Rangers](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Forest_Rangers "Forest Rangers") could deal with them. After [Lesser Lord Kusanali](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Lesser_Lord_Kusanali "Lesser Lord Kusanali") removed Rukkhadevata from Irminsul, the Withering was stopped for good, although the areas that it had affected prior to her removal still remains and poses a threat.
