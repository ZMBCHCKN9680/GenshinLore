![[Durin.webp]]

**Durin** was a shadow [dragon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon "Dragon") created by the alchemist "Gold" [[Rhinedottir]]. Five hundred years ago, during the [cataclysm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm"), he invaded [Mondstadt](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mondstadt "Mondstadt") and was slain by the might of [Dvalin](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dvalin "Dvalin").His corpse fell over the mountain of Vindagnyr, thereafter leading the mountain to become known as [[Dragonspine]].

The poisonous blood that flowed within Durin's veins, which contained power from the [[Abyss]], was one of the catalysts that led to Dvalin's resurgence as "Stormterror" during the events of the Archon Quest _[Prologue](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Prologue "Prologue")_.

## Profile

### Appearance

Durin has a monstrous form of a disfigured black skeletal dragon with glowing, red eyes. His wings have long veins running along the folds. Judging from his skeletal remains around Dragonspine, Durin is almost as large as the great snowy mountain itself.

### Personality

Durin had a gentle heart and dreamed of befriending Dvalin and the people of Mondstadt, and was apparently unconscious of his destructive actions in Mondstadt until Dvalin fatally wounded him. Even after he woke to find that he had been dealt a killing blow by Dvalin, Durin held no ill will toward Dvalin or [Barbatos](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Barbatos "Barbatos") and only wished that they could have met under better circumstances.

## Story

### History

Durin was created by Rhinedottir in the land of [[Khaenri'ah]] and classified under "Humus." Of her many creations, she considered Durin to be one of her "miraculous creations" alongside [Albedo](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Albedo "Albedo"), who would not come into being until after the cataclysm. She had, however, started the Primordial Human Project to create synthetic humans before Durin's invasion of Teyvat; [Primordial Albedo](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Primordial_Albedo "Primordial Albedo"), her first attempt, was considered a failure and left inside Durin.

Five hundred years ago, during the cataclysm, Durin emerged in Mondstadt and caused much devastation. The [[Knights of Favonius]] at the time had been preoccupied with a campaign in [Khaenri'ah](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Khaenri%27ah "Khaenri'ah") and suffered great casualties during the expedition; Wolf Pup [Rostam](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rostam "Rostam") perished in battle and Grand Master [Arundolyn](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Arundolyn "Arundolyn") gave up fighting in his grief. This left no one capable of defending the nation from Durin's rampage. Hearing the pleas of his people, Barbatos awoke and summoned Dvalin to come to their aid.

Barbatos and Dvalin fought together against Durin, luring him over the perpetually-snowy mountain of Vindagnyr. Dvalin ultimately managed to land a decisive blow by piercing Durin's neck with his fangs, and Durin was sent plummeting to the area now known as [Wyrmrest Valley](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wyrmrest_Valley "Wyrmrest Valley"). His blood soaked into the land, reviving the [[Frostbearing Tree]] which had been destroyed eons earlier by [Celestia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Celestia "Celestia")'s [Skyfrost Nail](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Skyfrost_Nail "Skyfrost Nail")

### Legacy

The mountain where Durin landed, previously known as Vindagnyr, thereafter became known as [Dragonspine](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonspine "Dragonspine"). Parts of Durin were used to forge the cursed sword [[Festering Desire]]
Dvalin, worn out from the battle and in pain from the poisoned blood he ingested, fell into a deep slumber in [Decarabian](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Decarabian "Decarabian")'s tower. He would eventually wake up to find a Mondstadt that had forgotten him, making him susceptible to the [[Abyss Order]]'s lies that Barbatos had abandoned him. During the events of the Prologue Chapter, a reawakened [Venti](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Venti "Venti") — Barbatos' alias — would join forces with the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler"), [Jean](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Jean "Jean"), and [Diluc](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Diluc "Diluc") to foil the Abyss Order's plot and restore Dvalin to his senses. Twice, Venti plays a tune explaining Dvalin's transformation into "Stormterror," during which Venti recounts the battle against Durin.

Primordial Albedo eventually broke free from Durin's stomach. After discovering the existence of a "successful" Albedo, he began conspiring to take the "successful" Albedo's place. To that end, he took on Albedo's appearance and used Durin's blood to create a [Fellflower](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Fellflower "Fellflower"), a heavily mutated [Cryo Whopperflower](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cryo_Whopperflower "Cryo Whopperflower"), having it take on the form of Albedo as well to serve as a distraction, although it was destroyed during the events of [Shadows Amidst Snowstorms](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Shadows_Amidst_Snowstorms "Shadows Amidst Snowstorms").

## Trivia

-   Durin's skull faces towards the west-northwest, where [Celestia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Celestia "Celestia") floats above. [Roald](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Roald "Roald") the Adventurer wondered if Durin still "yearns for the celestial heights".
-   Durin is likely the "evil dragon that once wrought havoc on a neighboring land" whose dried but still highly potent blood is allegedly in a bottle that [Linlang](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Linlang "Linlang") shows to the Traveler in her regular nighttime dialogue. The only other known dragon that might fit the description is [Ursa the Drake](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ursa_the_Drake "Ursa the Drake"), and Ursa's blood is not (yet) known to be venomous, unlike Durin's blood.

### Etymology

-   In Norse mythology, both [Durin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durinn "wikipedia:Durinn") and [Dvalin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvalinn "wikipedia:Dvalinn") are dwarves first mentioned in the [_Poetic Edda_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_Edda "wikipedia:Poetic Edda"). In the [Hervarar saga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hervarar_saga "wikipedia:Hervarar saga"), Durin forges the mythical sword Tyrfing with Dvalin's help.
-   According to the description of the [Concealed Unguis](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Concealed_Unguis "Concealed Unguis"), Durin was classified as "Humus". In [soil science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soil_science "wikipedia:soil science"), humus is formed when dead plant and animal matter within soil is broken down even further by [anaerobes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism "wikipedia:Anaerobic organism"), becoming dark in color. The presence of humus in soil helps boost its fertility.
