## Lore

Riftwolves are monsters from the [[Abyss]] and are said to be able to erode the boundaries of the world. They were created by the alchemist [Gold](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rhinedottir "Rhinedottir"). Once prevalent throughout Teyvat during the [cataclysm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm"), they were the advance guard for the other monsters that were behind them.

After the cataclysm, the riftwolves were driven to low numbers by numerous hunts and resistance, but have started to re-emerge once more, starting in Inazuma. A group of riftwolves also appeared in [Wolvendom](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wolvendom "Wolvendom") and began to cause havoc to the surrounding area.

## Trivia

-   [Rhinedottir](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rhinedottir "Rhinedottir"), the alchemist that created the Riftwolves, classified them as "Alfisol". According to [USDA soil taxonomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USDA_soil_taxonomy "wikipedia:USDA soil taxonomy"), Alfisols are a soil order for soils that contain aluminium and iron. They also contain a clay-enriched [subsoil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subsoil "wikipedia:subsoil") and are typically very fertile.
