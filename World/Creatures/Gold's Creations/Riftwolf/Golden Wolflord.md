> On an island on which no humans dwell, a golden king of beasts has commanded its pack of followers to pave the way through space for it.
> One can only wonder: what dreams might be woven from the sharp claws and fangs of these hidden beasts? And what impulses drive them to invade this world?



![[Enemy_Golden_Wolflord.webp|475]]

## Descriptions 

> A twisted beast from another world.
> This creature is the ruler of the [[Rifthound|Riftwolves]], and wields the power to command them to dissolve space itself.

> Hailing from a dark world, this ruler of the black wolves has the power to call upon its followers, its hidden claws, to dissolve space itself and forge a rift through which it may enter.
> The Wolflord has no name, for it was but one of "[[Rhinedottir|Gold]]'s'" unintentional creations, and that is precisely why it is obsessed with invading worlds that do not belong to it and making a name for itself.
> That said, the wolf pack is far from unintelligent. After suffering a defeat in its previous invasion, a deserted island where no humans or protectors dwell has been selected for them to prepare for their lord's descent.
