#Khaenriah 

Ruin Machines are ancient machines from the lost nation of [[Khaenri'ah]] and can be found across [Teyvat](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Teyvat "Teyvat"), particularly in the ruins of ancient civilizations. However, these Ruin Machines do not come from the same source as the ruins they inhabit, with a time difference of up to several thousand years.

Humanoid Ruin Machines take on a Cyclops-like design, though they differ in terms of size and build. Except for Ruin Graders, they speak in an unknown language when attacking. By targeting their weak points — their glowing eyes or, on Ruin Graders, the weak points on their back and feet — they can be stunned, causing them to be temporarily disabled and lie defenseless on the ground. These weak points are immune to attack when circular runes or text appear around them. Ruin Graders are significantly sturdier and are not left as defenseless as their other counterparts.

Ruin Sentinels take on forms of various animals from both real life and in-game. By targeting their weak points — their oculi - they can be stunned, causing them to be temporarily disabled. While not as strong as a Ruin Grader, Ruin Sentinels are more durable than most humanoid Ruin Machines, in that they may need their weak point struck twice, as the first successful hit may simply stagger the machine, whereas a second hit outright disables them like the humanoid ones suffer. Unlike their humanoid counterparts, the Ruin Sentinels willingly expose their weak spot while performing specific attacks.

Ruin Drakes can be find winged or wingless, being modeled on [geovishaps](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Vishaps "Vishaps"). While performing their signature attack, if it is not interrupted, the Ruin Drake will "infuse" the element they were harmed with the most, causing them to gain increased resistance to that element and apply it to their signature attack when they use it again. If no elemental damage had been inflicted, no infusion is made. Like the previous ruin machines, they can willingly expose their weak spot(s); like humanoid ruin machines, a single hit to the weak spot(s) will disable them instantly. This will also remove the infusion should they had done so previously.

They are usually given distinct letter-number "serial codes," followed by 5 digits. Ruin Guards have a prefix is "Hu-"; Ruin Hunters have a prefix is "Fo-"; Ruin Graders have a prefix is "Ra-"; Ruin Sentinels have a prefix of "Ald-"; Ruin Drakes have a prefix of "Faf-."

### Origins

The people of Khaenri'ah called them Field Tillers, a codename based on the saying "The land is not to be tilled with farming tools, but rather to be fought for with steel and blood". Following the fall of Khaenri'ah, the Ruin Machines wandered aimlessly across Teyvat for hundreds of years, mostly ending up in the ruins of former civilizations, causing the people of the present era to mistake them as the guardians of the ruins, hence terming them "Ruin Machines". Some have completely broken down, while others remain active and roaming, or inactive until they sense people nearby.

The first known automaton was a prototype [Field Tiller](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Weird_Statue "Weird Statue"), which [[Dainsleif]] states to be stronger than the many created after it, despite sharing the same appearance as them. It is unknown if the Ruin Hunters or Graders were variants improved from the mass-produced series.

Interacting with the inactive Ruin Guards in the [Record of Serial No.](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Record_of_Serial_No. "Record of Serial No.") puzzle gives the decoded message: _"For the nation, we can't forgo this [skyborne power](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Celestia "Celestia"), but we failed."_ It is unclear whether these Ruin Machines belonged to the main civilization that dwelt there, [Sal Vindagnyr](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sal_Vindagnyr "Sal Vindagnyr"), but current Dragonspine lore attributes the fall of Sal Vindagnyr to Celestia and the dropping of the [Skyfrost Nail](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Skyfrost_Nail "Skyfrost Nail").

Ruin Machines (Ruin Guards and Ruin Hunters at least) were already being made during or before the [Archon War](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Archon_War "Archon War"), as the realm created by the [adepti](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Adepti "Adepti") in [Liyue](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Liyue "Liyue") to store _"several ancient and evil artifacts"_ acquired by [Guizhong](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Guizhong "Guizhong") contained Ruin Guards and single Ruin Hunter.

As part of the [Fatui](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Fatui "Fatui")'s research into the [[Abyss]], the [Harbinger](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Harbinger "Harbinger") [Il Dottore](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Il_Dottore "Il Dottore") built a Ruin Guard [research facility](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wonderful_World_Of_Mr._Cyclops "The Wonderful World Of Mr. Cyclops") in [Liyue](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Liyue "Liyue"), which remained operational after he deserted the facility out of boredom. According to [Childe](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tartaglia "Tartaglia"), these machines are not built by the Fatui, but have some connection to the [Abyss Order](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Abyss_Order "Abyss Order"). He is not clear if the Abyss Order created them or simply took advantage of them.

Ruin Sentinels are animal-like machines which are particularly prevalent in [Inazuma](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Inazuma "Inazuma") alongside humanoid ruin machines. They were also brought into [Enkanomiya](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Enkanomiya "Enkanomiya") by the people of Khaenri'ah.

Ruin Machines also appeared in [The Chasm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chasm "The Chasm"), with both normal and sentinel-type machines being dug up in the area.

In [Sumeru](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sumeru "Sumeru"), massive Ruin Machines known as [Ruin Golems](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ruin_Golem "Ruin Golem") once prowled the land, who were sent with the [Schwanenritter](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Schwanenritter "Schwanenritter") for reasons unknown. These machines dwarf over all other known models; while most features are unknown, they were manually operated by a human crew and were tedious to maintain in part due to their huge size. Three golems currently exist; one at [Devantaka Mountain](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Devantaka_Mountain "Devantaka Mountain"), another at the [Valley of Dahri](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Valley_of_Dahri "Valley of Dahri"), and a final one at the ancient city of [Gurabad](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Gurabad "Gurabad"). In addition to Ruin Golems, Ruin Drakes can be found roaming Sumeru alongside the other models.


## Trivia

-   According to the description of the third phase of [Peculiar Wonderland](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Invitation_of_Windblume/Peculiar_Wonderland "Invitation of Windblume/Peculiar Wonderland"), Ruin Machines stand 15 meters tall, although the description did not clarify whether this referred to Ruin Guards or Ruin Graders, which differ in height. It's possible that it is referring to the Ruin Grader.
-   [Ruin Guards' names](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ruin_Guard#Trivia "Ruin Guard") are prefixed with Hu-, HU-, or GN/Hu. [Ruin Hunters' names](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ruin_Hunter#Trivia "Ruin Hunter") are prefixed with Fo-. [Ruin Graders' names](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ruin_Grader "Ruin Grader") are prefixed with Ra-. [Ruin Sentinels' names](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ruin_Sentinels "Ruin Sentinels") are prefixed with Ald-. [Ruin Drakes' names](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ruin_Drakes "Ruin Drakes") are prefixed with Faf-. All prefixes are followed by 5 numbers except for one case of 4 numbers following Hu-. See the individual pages for more details.
-   Ruin Machines bear similarities to living or elemental counterparts - Ruin Drakes being a mechanical version of [Geovishaps](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Geovishap "Geovishap") due to their elemental infusion, the Ruin Serpent being a mechanical version of the [Setekh Wenut](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Setekh_Wenut "Setekh Wenut") as both specialize in boring holes and the Perpetual Mechanical Array being similar to the [Hypostases](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hypostases "Hypostases").
-   [Sandrone](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sandrone "Sandrone"), a [Fatui Harbinger](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Fatui_Harbinger "Fatui Harbinger"), is accompanied by what appears to be a modified version of a Ruin Machine; indicated by the similar symbols found in both Automatons.
