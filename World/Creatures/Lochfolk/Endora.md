**Endora** is a commemorative gadget obtained at the end of the [Wishful Drops](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wishful_Drops "Wishful Drops") Event.

Endora is not a true gadget and is merely toggled on when equipped, thus regular gadgets can still be used as per normal. As it lacks the abilities which the Inquisitive version possesses, it is purely a cosmetic item.

## Endora's Educational Notes

Endora's Educational Notes are expanded and completed by capturing mer-creatures in the [Wishful Drops](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wishful_Drops "Wishful Drops") event.

> Want to grow quickly. Want to find Rhodeia.  
>   
> A child. New life, like Endora. A child's mission is to grow. To grow? I thought it was to see the world.  
>   
> Love. For Oceanids, this is to meld together as one. There will be no division then. That is why Oceanids need no learning or thoughts of their own. All that is needed is love.  
>   
> It seems that Oceanids cannot love others, for others will only drown in the embrace of pure waters. So they disguise themselves as the dreams of young children, and withdraw from the lives of all other people.  
>   
> Every day, a child takes a stumbling step forward. Every day, a stream flows into the sea.  
>   
> Love, that is our destiny. But I still have a whole world left to see.

## Trivia

-   In Chinese, her name is transcribed as 嫣朵拉 _Yānduǒlā_, where the character 嫣 _yān_ literally means "beautiful."
    -   Coincidentally, the character 嫣えん can be read as _en_ in Japanese, which more closely matches her English name.
    -   In Japanese, her name is transcribed as エンドラー _Endoraa_.
-   Her name is quite similar to the name of an [Oceanid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanids "wikipedia:Oceanids") from Greek mythology, [Eudora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudora_(mythology) "wikipedia:Eudora (mythology)").
-   Endora may be derived from the city [Endor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endor_(village) "wikipedia:Endor (village)") (Hebrew: עֵין־דֹּאר) (derived from Hebrew עַיִן _ayin_, "spring, fountain" + דּוֹר _dor_, "dwelling") which can mean "fountain of dwelling."
    -   Incidentally, the Lochfolk hail from the nation of [Fontaine](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Fontaine "Fontaine"), which means "fountain" in French.
