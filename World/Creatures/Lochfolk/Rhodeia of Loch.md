## Lore

Rhodeia is a [[Lochfolk]], who came from the Hydro nation, [[Fontaine]]. She was the greatest and strongest Lochfolk scout admired by many. As a Lochfolk, she swore allegiance to the previous Hydro Archon and lived in the bodies of water of Fontaine, acting as an informant or spy for her [Archon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Archon "Archon") and providing a connection for the people of her land. However, the Lochfolk at large do not agree with the plans and ideals of the current Hydro Archon, the [God of Justice](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/God_of_Justice "God of Justice"), and so refuse to acknowledge or support her.

Wanting for a small haven of tranquil waters, Rhodeia left her hometown and settled into a lake in Bishui, Plain. Sometime after her self-imposed exile, she sensed [Endora](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Endora "Endora") who she believed was an assassin sent from Fontaine. Her enmity towards the young lochfolk turned the waters sources on the border between Mondstadt and Liyue bitter. The bitter water killed fishes and greatly affected the [Dawn Winery](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dawn_Winery "Dawn Winery") which uses the nearby [river](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Bishui_River "Bishui River") for brewing wine With the help of the Traveler, Endora faced Rhodeia in a fight and reached an understanding. Still, Rhodeia remains unhappy and is waiting for the pure waters to become corrupted.

## Trivia

-   In Greek mythology, the [Oceanids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oceanids "wikipedia:List of Oceanids") were the nymph daughters of the Titan Oceanus. Rhodeia (also known as Rhodea or Rhodia) is one of them.
-   During [Albedo's Story Quest](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_First_Experiment:_Elements "The First Experiment: Elements"), he pronounces Oceanid as "O-**cee**-a-nid" (/oʊˈsiːənɪd/), which is an established pronunciation of the mythological being, in addition to "**Oh**-shen-id" (/ˈoʊʃənɪd/).
-   Unlike the other Normal Bosses, which are simply present and become aggressive when approached or attacked, Rhodeia is not initially present in her arena, with the player having to interact with her pool of water to begin the fight. She is also the only Normal Boss that appears in a random spot each time the player comes to challenge her, as said pool of water appears in one of the four corners of her arena.
-   When approaching the platform that consists as her arena, the weather will automatically change to rain regardless of the surrounding climate. This special weather will persist until the player leaves the area if she is still present or is defeated.
