**Abyss Heralds** are an [elite](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Enemy "Elite Enemy") enemy group part of the [[Abyss Order]] and who are capable of manipulating intense abyssal energy. They are counterparts to [[Abyss Lector]] who use blades embedded in their arms to attack.

In combat, Abyss Heralds perform aggressive elemental attacks with their blades. When their HP is low, they will obtain a durable elemental [Shield](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Shield/Enemy "Shield/Enemy") which need to be destroyed using the correct [Elemental Reactions](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_Reaction "Elemental Reaction"). After the shield is destroyed, they will be immediately defeated.
