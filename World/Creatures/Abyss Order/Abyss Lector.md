**Abyss Lectors** are an [elite](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Enemy "Elite Enemy") enemy group part of the [[Abyss Order]] and who are capable of manipulating intense abyssal energy. They are counterparts to [[Abyss Herald]] who use catalysts to attack.

In combat, Abyss Lectors perform ranged elemental attacks with their catalysts. When their HP is low, they will obtain a durable elemental [Shield](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Shield/Enemy "Shield/Enemy") which needs to be destroyed using the correct [Elemental Reactions](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_Reaction "Elemental Reaction"). After the shield is destroyed, they will be immediately defeated.
