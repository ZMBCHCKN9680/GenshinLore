#Khaenriah #EclipseDynasty #Irmin 

The **Eclipse Dynasty** was the ruling dynasty of the [[Khaenri'ah]] up until 500 years ago, where its fall brought upon the [fall of Khaenri'ah](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm") itself

## Organization

As a royal family, the Eclipse Dynasty presumably had a king and/or queen, plus their children. Only one king has been mentioned so far, King [Irmin](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Irmin "Irmin"), who may also have been the last king of Khaenri'ah.

### Royal Guards

The Eclipse Dynasty had a force of royal guards known as the Black Serpent Knights, whose numbers included "Twilight Sword" [[Dainsleif]] and [Halfdan](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Halfdan "Halfdan"). After 500 years of suffering under the curse placed on the people of Khaenri'ah, the Black Serpent Knights have become [[The Black Serpents|Shadowy Husks]].

## Trivia

-   In [Mondstadt](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mondstadt "Mondstadt"), one of the three [hilichurl](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hilichurl "Hilichurl") tribes at [Dadaupa Gorge](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dadaupa_Gorge "Dadaupa Gorge") is called the Eclipse Tribe. In the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler")'s "About the Eclipse Tribe" [Voice-Over](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler/Voice-Overs "Traveler/Voice-Overs"), [Paimon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Paimon "Paimon") states that only the Dada [Samachurl](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Samachurl "Samachurl") knows why they revere the eclipse symbols that they draw, while the Traveler mulls over the word "eclipse." It turns out that the Traveler witnessed the destruction of Khaenri'ah and may have been familiar with the name "Eclipse Dynasty."
    -   The Eclipse Tribe is named similarly to the Eclipse Dynasty in English, Chinese (黑日 _Hēirì_, "Black Sun"), and Korean (검은 태양 _Geomeun Taeyang_, "Black Sun"). However, the Japanese name for the Eclipse Tribe uses the direct translation for solar eclipse (Japanese: 日食 _Nisshoku_).
-   Dainsleif's [Official Introduction](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dainsleif#Official_Introduction "Dainsleif") makes an allusion to the Eclipse Dynasty: _Chalk pursues gold, in this time inopportune, the eclipse is swallowed by the crimson moon._
    -   "Chalk pursues gold" refers to the alchemical process of creating the Magnum Opus, or masterpiece, which typically refers to the transmutation of gold. Albedo (chalk, or whiteness) is the second step in creating the Magnum Opus, while citrinitas (yellowness, or gold) is the fourth and final step.
        -   This phrase may also be an allusion to [Albedo](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Albedo "Albedo") (the Kreideprinz, or Chalk Prince) and his goal of reuniting with "Gold" [[Rhinedottir]], his creator.
    -   In the Chinese version of "The eclipse is swallowed by the crimson moon," the phrase translated as "swallowed by" is [复仇](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%BE%A9%E4%BB%87#Chinese "wiktionary:復仇") _fùchóu_, which can mean either "to revenge" or "to avenge." The imagery of a crimson moon is prominent both in the Story Trailer ["We Will Be Reunited"](https://youtu.be/SO__VQZirJ4?t=19), when Lumine (as the [Traveler's Sibling](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler%27s_Sibling "Traveler's Sibling")) recounts the events of the cataclysm, and in [Ei](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ei "Ei")'s [Plane of Euthymia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Plane_of_Euthymia "Plane of Euthymia"), which was created after Ei witnessed the events at Khaenri'ah.
