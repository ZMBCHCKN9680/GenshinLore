The **Seven Sovereigns** are the seven strongest elemental [dragons](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dragons "Dragons") of their respective element.

The original Seven Sovereigns were the rulers of the old world before the appearance of the [[The Primordial One]]. After 40 years of battle, the Seven Sovereigns were vanquished and those who refused to yield to the Primordial One fled to the depths of the ocean.

A new generation of Sovereigns is currently being born; it has been predicted that at least the Hydro one will be "born in a human form."

Like all vishaps and elemental dragons, the Seven Sovereigns are creatures of the [Light Realm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Realm "Light Realm") and harness one of the primordial elements. The Seven Sovereigns were the mightiest among dragon-kind and ruled over the old world and its seven nations.

When the Primordial One — the eternal throne of the heavens — appeared, it and its four shining shades waged war against the Seven Sovereigns. After a long struggle, the Primordial One vanquished the Seven Sovereigns and began remaking the world to be suitable for humanity, establishing the [Human Realm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Human_Realm "Human Realm"). Those who refused to yield to the Primordial One fled into the ocean depths.

With the original Seven Sovereigns' power fading away, a new generation is being born.

## Trivia :
- [Azhdaha](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Azhdaha "Azhdaha") is theorized to be one of the Seven Sovereigns of the Vishap Realm, as he is stated to be extremely old and is an elemental dragon. He is also referred to as a "dragon king" and as the "Sealed Lord of Vishaps" (Chinese: 被封印的岩龙之王 "Sealed King of Geo Dragons.")) This is similar to the original Dragon of Water's description as a "dragon-lord" (along with the other original Seven Sovereigns) and an "ancient lord of vishaps." However, the title of "dragon king/lord" is not exclusively used for the Seven Sovereigns, and too little is known about the Primordial One's era or the world that came before it to determine Azhdaha's place among them.
- The Seven Sovereigns are stated to be elemental dragons that are the prime embodiment of their elements of the Vishap/Light Realm. As one of the two known elemental dragons aside from Azhdaha, [Dvalin](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dvalin "Dvalin") might have some link to them as well.
