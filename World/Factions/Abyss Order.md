The **Abyss Order** is a mysterious, but powerful legion of monsters from [[Abyss]] who are the enemies of both humanity and surface civilization, and thrive in many corners of [Teyvat](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Teyvat "Teyvat").

Because most members of the Abyss Order reside in the Abyss, little is actually known about them by Teyvat at-large, other than that they hold a strong hatred against the people of the seven nations and their [Archons](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Archons "Archons"), and desire to overthrow the world ruled by the Archons. Many, if not all of its members were originally from [Khaenri'ah](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Khaenri%27ah "Khaenri'ah") prior to being cursed.

Their size, hierarchy, membership, leaders, degree of power, and threat level are largely unknown currently.

[Diluc](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Diluc "Diluc") warns the [Traveler](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler "Traveler") and [Paimon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Paimon "Paimon") that "there's more to the Abyss Order than just some Abyss Mages," implying there are monsters in the organization that are stronger and more dangerous that were not yet introduced. While this was later confirmed by the introduction of Abyss Heralds and Lectors, it is unknown if there are other members that have yet to reveal themselves.

## Members

-   [[Abyss Lector|Abyss Lectors]]
    -   [Enjou](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Enjou "Enjou")

-   [[Abyss Herald]]
-   [[Abyss Mage]]

### Hilichurls
The Order usually conscripts [Hilichurls](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hilichurls "Hilichurls") to do their work.

Because many hilichurls are cursed citizens from the destroyed nation of [Khaenri'ah](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Khaenri%27ah "Khaenri'ah"), the Abyss Order and the Traveler's Sibling hope to cleanse the curse from the hilichurls <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">so that they may either "return to the natural cycle of life and death as soon as possible" or, according to Dainsleif, become the foundation for the to-be-rebuilt Khaenri'ah if they are successfully cleansed.</mark>

## Story
In the [Archon Quest](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Archon_Quest "Archon Quest") [Chapter I](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_I "Chapter I"): Act IV - _[We Will Be Reunited](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/We_Will_Be_Reunited "We Will Be Reunited")_, Paimon and the Traveler begin to learn more of the truth behind the foundation of the Abyss Order: around 500 years ago, the fall of the [Eclipse Dynasty](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Eclipse_Dynasty "Eclipse Dynasty") led to a cataclysm that destroyed [Khaenri'ah](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Khaenri%27ah "Khaenri'ah"). The Abyss Order grew out of that destruction, formed of people from Khaenri'ah who sought revenge for that event, through the destruction of the Archons.

In the present, the Abyss Order is led by the [Traveler's Sibling](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler%27s_Sibling "Traveler's Sibling"), who was separated from the Traveler by the [Unknown God](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Unknown_God "Unknown God"), <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">traveled across Teyvat first and was disappointed by true nature of the world</mark>. It is unknown how they managed to become its current leader, but all of their subordinates revere them, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">addressing them in a royal manner.</mark>

Currently, the Abyss Order is attempting to execute their Loom of Fate operation. To this end, they plan to use the ancient technology behind the ["Field Tillers"](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ruin_Guard "Ruin Guard") from Khaenri'ah, and they searched many Ruin Guards hoping to find the eye of the very first one. With it and the [Defiled Statue](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Defiled_Statue "Defiled Statue") underneath [Mt. Aocang](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mt._Aocang "Mt. Aocang"), they intended to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">use both of them</mark> on [Osial](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Osial "Osial") to create a mechanized god they could control.The eye was found by the Traveler and Dainsleif at Stormterror's Lair, but Dainsleif opted to carry it with him rather than trust it to another party. When the pair returned to destroy the statue, they were met by an Abyss Herald, who was later saved by the Traveler's sibling. The operation is still active, although postponed due to Dainsleif safekeeping the first Field Tiller's eye.

A group led by [Enjou](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Enjou "Enjou") would later arrive in [[Lotus Eater]] to look for the book [[Before Sun and Moon]] to find proof that the gods came from outside Teyvat.

The Abyss Order became aware of an unusual pool of water in [The Chasm](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chasm "The Chasm") that would recede the effects of the curse placed upon them. The Traveler's sibling, determined to restore Khaenri'ah, authorized an experimental device that would supposedly amplify the water's effects despite not being informed of the success rate. The operation was foiled by both Dainsleif and the Traveler, the former having been accidentally sent to the Chasm and the latter investigating supposed hilichurl activity.

## Notes

-   Background stories that may related to the Abyss Order are told in some artifact set and weapon lores — notably that of [Arundolyn](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Arundolyn "Arundolyn"), Grand Master of the [Knights of Favonius](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Knights_of_Favonius "Knights of Favonius"), who led an expedition against the monsters that spewed forth from Khaenri'ah. While he survived, his friend and companion [Rostam](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rostam "Rostam") perished in battle.
    -   Rostam was mentor to a person known as the White Knight, later known as the [Bloodstained Knight](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Bloodstained_Knight "Bloodstained Knight"). After his violent path caused others to shun him, he continued his battle against the monsters in Khaenri'ah and ultimately perished. After death, however, he learned about the injustice behind Khaenri'ah's destruction, that caused the people of the land to be cursed and become monsters.
