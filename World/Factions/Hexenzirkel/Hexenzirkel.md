The **Hexenzirkel** is an organization of witches which conducts [Irminsul](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Irminsul "Irminsul") explorations and gathers around for "formal tea parties."

Not all witches are members. [Lisa](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa "Lisa"), the Witch of Purple Rose, explicitly denies her interest in the Hexenzirkel. [La Signora](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/La_Signora "La Signora"), who was once known as the Crimson Witch of Flame, has no known ties to the Hexenzirkel and takes great offense to being called a "witch" at all.

Once challenged the anemo archon, but Barbatos pacified them. They have vowed to never kill each other

## Trivia

-   [Mona](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mona "Mona")'s special dish [Der Weisheit letzter Schluss](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Der_Weisheit_Letzter_Schluss_(Life) "Der Weisheit Letzter Schluss (Life)") is a direct quote of the play "Faust" by the German poet Goethe. In _Faust_, a coven of witches convenes on top of the windy mountain Brocken in Germany's Harz Mountains, an area infamous for its folklore of witches and witchcraft.
-   If the player has completed _[Inversion of Genesis](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Inversion_of_Genesis "Inversion of Genesis")_, during the final section of _Joy Above the Clouds_, the Traveler will question whether the strange voice they heard at the end of [As Though Morning Dew](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/As_Though_Morning_Dew "As Though Morning Dew") was actually Nicole.

## Notes :

- 7 chair on the meeting table
- Cutscene dialogues :
	- Alice : Narattor
	- Rhinedottir : I'm raising a son. Of all the children I had, he's the only one left, But I suppose that still makes me a mother?
	- Andersdotter : My lifespan is nothing compared to yours, so I wish to leave you with my storybook. Actually, maybe you can pass it on to your children one day
	- Barbeloth : Ooh, this looks interesting. Let me scry! 
	- I. Ivanovna N. : Yesterday, I snuffed out the life of my beloved. He had grown old and was extremely sick. He loved me dearly, so I took his fate in my hands, and ended his pain
	- Nicole : Absent?
